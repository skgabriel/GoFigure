The teenager who died in a water-filled quarry in County Tyrone is the third member of his extended family to die in a drowning tragedy. The body of Rhys Jack was recovered from the disused quarry in the Backtown area of Strabane on Tuesday afternoon. Parish priest, Father Michael Doherty, said both of the teenager's parents had lost family members through drowning. His mother lost her five-year-old brother about 40 years ago, while his father's uncle drowned in recent years. Father Doherty has been with members of the Jack family since the tragedy began to unfold on Monday evening. The 17-year-old was in the quarry with three teenage friends when they fell into the water from a makeshift raft. His three friends, who were later rescued, had frantically tried to save him. Father Doherty told BBC Radio Ulster's Evening Extra programme that Rhys's parents, Elaine and Mark, identified his body at the quarry shortly after it was recovered by search teams. He said: ""They knew over the past day, or from about eight o'clock last night (20:00 BST) that although they would have liked to have thought there was a chance he would be still alive, they knew that he was gone and their hope was that the body would be found sooner rather than later."" The priest said that their ""deep sadness"" at losing their son was mixed with ""relief"". He explained that the corpse of Elaine Jack's young brother had never been found, so they were relieved that Rhys's body had been recovered. He also said it was his understanding that Mark Jack's uncle had drowned in the River Finn a number of years ago. Father Doherty was the Jack family's parish priest and had baptised Rhys 17 years ago. He was also a chaplain at the teenager's school. The priest said the three friends who had tried to save Rhys were ""traumatised and upset"". He described the atmosphere in Rhys's school as ""subdued"" and said staff had tried to make special arrangements for those taking exams.",ADD ERROR,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,Funerals shouldn't be plural,TRUE,FALSE,Extrinsic entity error (Entity does not appear in article or gold summary),Extrinsic entity error (Entity does not appear in article or gold summary),,,,

This is expected to cost up to í‰Œ£80m. Some pupils would be tested for academic ability but the scheme would not just target the brightest children. Chief inspector of schools Sir Michael Wilshaw said the plan was not enough. The proposal, originally seen by the BBC and now confirmed, will be made in the ISC's response to a government consultation on the future of education. The scheme would be open to primary and secondary school-age children. But details about which families would benefit and what form the tests would take are yet to be settled and the scheme could not take place without the government's approval. Currently it costs an average of í‰Œ£30,000 to send a pupil to board and í‰Œ£15,500 for a day school for a year. The plan is designed to meet government demands that - in exchange for its tax-free, charitable status - the private education sector does more for potential pupils whose families cannot afford to pay the fees.

It would mean reviving something similar to the Assisted Places Scheme, which supported means-tested places in private schools in the 1980s and 1990s. They were not ""free"" places, but taxpayer-funded. Scrapping this scheme was one of the first symbolic acts of the Blair government in 1997. Labour argued that public money should be focused on improving state education for the majority - and not used for life rafts into the private sector for a minority. But now the independent schools are testing the water with the May government.

On a subject as sensitive as giving the police and security services access to phone and internet data this is bound to be controversial. Update 08:45 BST: The emergency legislation will oblige telecom firms to retain data for 12 months. Under the European law which it replaces companies could be asked to retain data for 24 months. More controversially the new law will also produce what is being described as a ""clearer legal framework"" to allow access to the content of calls, texts and emails after a warrant is signed by a senior government minister. Telecoms companies are said to have warned ministers that after the Edward Snowden revelations they are vulnerable to legal challenge by their customers. The Labour MP Tom Watson has condemned the plans as a ""stitch up"" which prevent MPs from considering the legislation properly.",ADD ERROR,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,,TRUE,FALSE,Extrinsic entity error (Entity does not appear in article or gold summary),,,,,

(Until the nation's cynics get to work, of course.) Instead, they are the attributes with which Scotland's tourism agency is seeking to engage Scots and their spirit in making the country more attractive to visitors. There's a lot to do if VisitScotland and the industry are to hit an ambitious target. And it's one of the sectors that needs to succeed if Scotland is to turn around a formidable rise in its trade imbalance. The trade imbalance may not matter much, so long as Scotland is tied into the pound and part of the UK. But it is a useful indicator of economic health, and rather important to those who want to see another independence referendum. The Scottish government's figures for the whole Scottish economy have just been published, to cover the third quarter of last year, up to September. They show that, between July and September, Scots sold í‰Œ£6.1bn of goods and services overseas. They imported í‰Œ£5.1bn. That's a trade surplus, while the UK as a whole is running some very large external trade deficits. So that can't be bad for Scotland. But what about trade within the UK? Scots sold goods and services worth í‰Œ£10.4bn in the third quarter to the people of England, Wales and Northern Ireland. The flow coming the other way was rather larger: í‰Œ£15.2bn. The trade deficit with the rest of the UK rose to í‰Œ£14bn in 2014, from an economy with total output of nearly í‰Œ£140bn. John McLaren, a keen observer of these numbers, who used to work for Public Finance Scotland, observes that the first nine months of last year saw that deteriorate sharply. Roughly í‰Œ£750m less was being sold to the rest of the UK, and í‰Œ£750m more was being bought from it. The fall in sales success to this dominant market, McLaren points out, has real implications for prosperity and jobs. Exports and imports, overseas and to the rUK, combined to reach a deficit in the third quarter of í‰Œ£4.25bn, the highest quarter on record. When the fourth quarter figures are published, the annual total is probably going to be above í‰Œ£15bn. The previous record was as recession struck in 2008, at just under í‰Œ£12bn.

The group of three are being held responsible for the deaths of eight Turkish and one Greek immigrant between 2000 and 2006, as well as a German policewoman in 2007. Yet the existence of the group, dubbed the Zwickau cell after the name of the town where they spent most of their time in hiding, only came to light in November when two of its members died in an apparent joint suicide or murder-suicide and the third handed herself in to the authorities. The NPD has been linked to the group, though the allegations have yet to be accepted in a court of law. The trio had made a DVD in which they boasted of the killings and said they had acted to serve the German nation and its people, describing themselves as the National Socialist Underground - echoing the national socialism (Nazism) of Hitler's Germany. The story of the killers has dominated headlines in Germany for months now and given rise to one of the biggest scandals in post-war Germany. It turns out intelligence agencies had had the group under surveillance for years, and even found a bomb-making factory in their garage back in 1998. So why were the trio not stopped earlier? Why were they allowed to disappear and then stay underground? And why was it that security services blamed the murders on the Turkish mafia at the time? A right-wing motive was never investigated. The failures have prompted some to ask whether there is more than incompetence to blame, whether Germany's police and security services contain elements sympathetic to the far right - an accusation the institutions vehemently deny. A parliamentary inquiry is currently under way into their activities, and Newsnight has seen a secret internal report revealing serious blunders by law enforcement agencies. When we spoke to Peter Altmaier, a senior official in Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democrat party, he admitted that mistakes had been made: ""You have to know Germany is a federal state, and competencies are shared and divided between federal and state levels... and because we have drawn the lessons from the Nazi dictatorship, we have very limited powers of police and security institutions.",ADD ERROR,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,,FALSE,TRUE,,,,,,

""This is an absolute disaster for a company the size of ours,"" says Mr Saha. ""The very sharp fall in the pound means the impact is at least a quarter of a million pounds a month for us. This is having a very negative impact on our business and we are really suffering. It's now come to a point where it's not sustainable for us."" The news comes amid warnings of rising prices in the grocery sector, and with supermarket chain Morrisons increasing the cost of a jar of Marmite by 12.5%. There are plenty of winners from the fall in the value of sterling. But Typhoo Tea is a graphic illustration of what it's like for a business with one raw imported material. Typhoo has been trading for more than a century. These days, most of its black tea comes from Kenya. It's then blended and packaged on site. The company also packages own-label tea for most of the major supermarkets. In addition, it produces a range of herbal teas and those ingredients are sourced in euros. It's a high-volume, low-margin business. The cost of the ingredient depends on the quality of the leaf. A typical 80kg bag of black tea could be bought for í‰Œ£90 to í‰Œ£100 at the beginning of the year. The company says that same bag now costs í‰Œ£120 to í‰Œ£150 at the weekly international auctions. In other words, it is paying an awful lot more for the same amount of tea. ""We don't have big enough margins between us and retailers to absorb all these costs. We're looking at how to mitigate some of them, from our labour, overheads and marketing costs, which will affect the growth of the business and employment in long run. But some of these currency costs will have to be passed on, as neither us nor the retailers can absorb any more cost increases,"" Mr Saha says. Like other suppliers, he is in discussions with",ADD ERROR,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,,TRUE,FALSE,Extrinsic entity error (Entity does not appear in article or gold summary),Other,,,,

But campaigners have criticised the failure to meet the standards set out. ""The time for excuses is over,"" said David Isaac, chair of the Equality and Human Rights Commission. ""The Premier League promised that disabled access would be improved by the start of next season, so it is disappointing that a number of clubs will fail to meet that deadline. ""Clubs need to urgently demonstrate to us what they are doing to ensure they are compliant with the law and how they are making it easier for disabled fans to attend matches. If they don't they will face legal action."" The Premier League's report comes after MPs argued last month that top-flight clubs were prioritising finance over improving access and meeting the Accessible Stadia Guidelines. The Culture, Media and Sport select committee report said clubs should face legal action if they fail to meet the basic needs of disabled fans. The Premier League board can impose fines of up to í‰Œ£25,000, while cases of serious breaches would be referred to an independent panel - which could impose heavier fines or even deduct points. Bournemouth have 195 disabled fan spaces but not to the required standard. However, they do not own their Vitality Stadium home and the club says that the stadium's small size makes meeting guidelines difficult. It is planning to move to a bigger ground in the coming years. Chelsea have 128 spaces for disabled fans, against a recommended 214. The club is aiming to move to a new 60,000-seat stadium and says in the meantime it will consult with disabled fans. Watford have spaces for 61 disabled fans, but should provide 153. It will have more wheelchair spaces by August but says it faces architectural challenges and is aiming to make other improvements to boost the matchday experience of disabled fans.

Before 1996, manufactured groups were expected to obey management and music label orders. Even though the five were put together by Bob and Chris Herbert, the group soon decided to replace the father-and-son management team with Simon Fuller.  And against record company advice, they also chose their first single.

Business rates in England and Wales are being updated to take into account changes in property values. However, the government says a cap on how much bills can rise will cushion the impact for firms facing increases. The letter written by the ALMR on behalf of its members says that ""on average, the pub sector will see a 15% increase and restaurants a 23% increase across the country"".

The ALMR represents leading brands, including Pizza Express, Wagamama and Yo Sushi, as well as smaller businesses operating from only one or two premises. ""We would urge you to consider reviewing the transitional relief provisions and the introduction of sector specific hospitality retail relief,"" the letter says. Rates are calculated by multiplying the rateable value of a property by a multiplier set by the government. But as property values change over time, rateable values need to be reassessed periodically - usually every five years. However this update to property values is two years behind schedule, making it a harder pill to swallow in areas where the price of real estate has been rising. A statement from the Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG) said that most businesses will not face sharp rises in costs. ""Following the revaluation, three-quarters of properties will see no change or even a fall in their bills, and the small minority of businesses that face an increase will benefit from our í€äó_í‰Œ£3.6bn transitional relief scheme,"" it said. However, property experts have predicted that some businesses, especially in thriving commercial centres and the south-east of England could see very dramatic changes to their rates bills, by as much as several hundred percent. Many pubs and restaurants occupy prime real estate in town and city centres. The DCLG added that many pubs had seen turnover increase significantly since the last rates valuation in 2010 as a result of the growth in casual dining. That increase in revenue would affect the rateable value of the property, it said.

The two vessels were last seen in the summer of that year bypassing whaling boats in Baffin Bay, off the coast of Greenland. But soon afterwards, the ships vanished.

In a country where backbench rebellions are almost unknown, politicians contend themselves with hints of dissent in anti-government media, and more open attacks on Viktor Orban's policies in pro-government media. A new, pro-Russian foreign policy sits particularly awkwardly in a party which rose to fame in 1989 as the first to demand publicly that Soviet troops leave Hungary. It began with a photograph of Viktor Orban shaking hands with Russian President Vladimir Putin in January, after signing a highly controversial nuclear expansion deal. When the Russians annexed Crimea in March, the Budapest government criticised the beleaguered Ukrainian government in Kiev, and stated publicly that all it cared about was the Hungarian minority in western Ukraine. In July, Hungary's embassy in Estonia was closed down at a moment when the Baltic states - Hungary's Nato allies - felt under most pressure from Moscow. Mr Orban has consistently opposed EU and US sanctions against Russia, on the grounds that ""we should be doves in economic policy, and hawks in defence"". In an August speech to Hungary's ambassadors, he called openly for an unprincipled foreign policy, placing foreign investment in Hungary above any moral considerations such as a trade partner's human rights record. And in September, within an hour of Mr Orban meeting with the chief of Russia's state-owned gas giant, Gazprom, the reverse flow of gas to Ukraine in Hungary's pipelines, which had been annoying Russia, was stopped. Dismay is growing within Fidesz at his domestic policy too: at government corruption, the playboy lifestyle of numerous party officials, and an economic policy which consistently suppresses the value of the Hungarian currency, the forint.

The economy has boomed in recent years and Ivory Coast is the world's biggest exporter of cocoa, producing around 40% of the planet's beans used to manufacture chocolate. But this year, it also overtook India as the leading exporter of cashew nuts. Cocoa transformed Ivory Coast into the ""Paris of Africa"" as it was called in the 1970s and 1980s, until a slump in cocoa prices dampened the ""Ivorian miracle"". President Alassane Ouattara, who took office in May 2011, wanted to diversify the economy. Agriculture is still the backbone, but it includes bananas, rubber and palm oil too. The last elections in 2010 sparked five months of violence when former President Laurent Gbagbo refused to step down. More than 3,000 people were killed in some of the most brutal violence the country has ever seen. President Ouattara has been accused of one-sided justice after hundreds of Mr Gbagbo's supporters were imprisoned but very few from his side were even arrested - despite the UN and international human rights organisations saying both sides committed atrocities. No more ""nids de poules"" on the country's major roads. The French call potholes ""chicken nests"". The government says it has built 1,000km (620 miles) of new roads since it has been in power and rehabilitated another 20,000km throughout Ivory Coast. It is promising to build 1,200km more if re-elected. There were 10, now there are seven.

The number of police officers in England and Wales has already fallen by about 16,000 since 2010 because of cuts in Home Office funding. Labour's sums are based on assumptions about the amounts all unprotected government departments are likely to have to be cut to meet the targets for cutting the deficit, which were set out in the Budget. The Conservatives are yet to set out plans for the next three years of funding for the Home Office. Labour says it has identified í€äó_í‰Œ£800m of savings that could be made in police forces, which would prevent the loss of 10,000 jobs that it says the Conservatives would have to cut in the next three years. Labour's figures assume that all departments will be cut by the same amount. Of course, when the next government has its spending review, it could decide to make much more severe cuts to some departments than others. Labour says it will save í€äó_í‰Œ£800m by doing things such as scrapping the elections for police and crime commissioners, which are due to take place next year, and making people pay the full cost when they apply for a gun licence. The Conservatives respond that scrapping commissioners and other measures would not save as much as Labour claims and that they have already announced plans to increase the fees for gun licences. The biggest proposed savings come from making it compulsory for police forces to buy things together to increase their negotiating power. The Conservatives say that already happens in a lot of cases but that Labour has overestimated the potential savings. The Tories also point out that, despite the falls in police numbers over the past five years, crime has fallen. The two things may be unrelated and crime has been falling since the late 1990s. So it is difficult to demonstrate either that if the Conservatives were to win the election they would cut 10,000 police staff over the next three years or indeed that Labour's plans would prevent that happening. What this argument does highlight is how tight a timetable the next government will be working to. Departments only have spending plans laid out for a year from now. The previous government did not manage to have a spending review until 20 October 2010. There is frantic contingency planning going on all over the civil service.

The government said the building was home to 278 boys, 174 girls and six infants under the age of three. Also rescued were 138 adults aged up to 40, the government said. Reports say the residents were forced to live in terrible conditions.

The House of the Big Family has been operating for 40 years and was known locally as Mama Rosa's Home. The authorities began to investigate the home after parents complained that they were denied access to their children. One woman, who grew up at the home herself, gave birth to two children who were registered in the name of Ms Verduzco. When the mother left the home, aged 31, she was not allowed to take her children with her, investigators said. Mr Jara said the raid came after an official complaint was filed by the parents of five children who said they were being held at the home against their will.

The 2015 Young Australian of the Year is 21-year-old West Australian Drisana Levitzke-Gray, a young deaf woman who advocates for other deaf people. Senior Australian of the Year is 61-year-old Jackie French from New South Wales, a children's author and advocate for children with learning difficulties, and the Australian Local Hero is 41-year-old Juliette Wright from Queensland, who established an online platform to get goods and services to vulnerable and marginalised people.

The father and son had been playing together during an access visit in February 2014 when Anderson suddenly struck his son with a cricket bat and stabbed him.

The force secured interim injunctions in 2016 and said at the time it did not want to identify anyone until they were permanent.

But the wilderness of the non-league scene is exactly where the lifelong association between Flynn and Newport begun. Given a reprieve by manager Tim Harris and a chance with the first team after his youth team axing, Flynn also found employment as a postman. Thanks to his form with the Exiles, a nickname earned rather than chosen after years spent out of the city as a reformed club without a home, Flynn impressed as a midfielder with an eye for goal. In the non-league pyramid at least, this postman did always deliver. A switch to full time football was the dream, achieved with a transfer to Barry Town, a move that changed the course of Flynn's life. There was to be no future in shelf stacking or letter delivering for Flynn after joining the full time Welsh Premier League side, as he went on to make over 400 Football League appearances for the likes of Gillingham, Wigan and Bradford City. He returned to his first club and first love Newport County five years ago, helping to steer them to a promotion 25 years in the making. Flynn was 'heartbroken' when the club released him as Terry Butcher axed 11 players, after Newport's millionaire chairman Les Scadding opted to walk away from the club. He soon returned when the Supporters' Trust succeeded Scadding, working in various roles including as a club ambassador, in marketing, and as a first team coach. He even found time to get in a few games for Welsh League third-tier side Undy, so it was no surprise this season when Flynn came out of retirement to help the beleaguered Exiles. Flynn's career at County, and in football, was almost over before it started. ""I got kicked out of the youth team. The youth team manager Glyn Jones asked me what I had done at the weekend and I said I had played for Pill. He said 'I know, I saw in the local paper you scored a hat-trick.'

This time he was in the unfamiliar green kit of Real Madrid for a last-16 tie against United with the score delicately poised at 1-1 after the first leg in Spain. This was to become a bittersweet homecoming for the 28-year-old Portuguese. Ronaldo stayed on the field warming up with his pristine red boots for 16 minutes. His task: to keep his emotions under control and focus on the job of firing nine-time winners Madrid into the Champions League quarter finals. It was all about concentration. Ronaldo never once looked up at the vast Sir Alex Ferguson stand over his left shoulder as he practised shooting from 20 yards just to the left of centre - and finding the net every time. Warm-ups done and it was time for team embraces. High-fives all round. Madrid's players were as one and after a few stretching routines to finish, it was time to head back for the Special One's final instructions - the final team talk from Real Madrid manager Jose Mourinho. Ronaldo emerged again at 19:41 GMT. This time the atmosphere was hot, red hot.  And at 19:44 there was a special moment as the PA announcer ran through the team line-ups. ""And it's a special welcome back to number seven Cristiano Ronaldo,"" he boomed. Ronaldo waved, thumped his chest, waved again. His head bowed for a respectful moment before putting his hand back on to his chest. Just for a moment, those emotions must have threatened to run away from him. And the Manchester United support welcomed him back with a standing ovation which lasted until after referee Cuneyt Cakir started the match. United had the better of the first half and largely managed to shackle Ronaldo. When Sergio Ramos steered the ball into his own net to give the home side a 1-0 lead on the night, Old Trafford erupted and Ronaldo's head went down. He looked momentarily forlorn. And then the match changed irreversibly. Nani was shown a contentious red card for a high challenge on Real defender Alvaro Arbeloa.

England are next in action on Tuesday when they face Sweden, the Olympic silver medallists from Rio, in Murcia.

Last year Angelina Jolie had her ovaries and fallopian tubes removed after she was found to be at an increased risk of ovarian cancer due to a ""faulty"" BRCA 1 gene.

A series of public blunders, questionable calls and U-turns on key policies have since resulted in a decline in his popularity. In February 2015 he survived a challenge from MPs within his own party that had threatened to remove him from the top job less than 18 months in. But in September he was challenged once again by former communications minister Malcolm Turnbull - and ousted in a hastily-arranged vote. Tony Abbott was born in 1957 in England to Australian parents who returned to Sydney a few years later. After graduating in economics and law from the University of Sydney, where he was also a leading student boxer, he attended Oxford as a Rhodes Scholar, studying politics and philosophy. He briefly trained as a Catholic priest, before working as a journalist for the Australian newspaper. He then worked as an adviser to the Liberal Party, before entering politics in 1994 when he was elected to represent the affluent Warringah district of Sydney. Under former Prime Minister John Howard, he served as an employment minister between 1998 and 2001 and as minister for health and ageing in 2003. In 2009, he narrowly beat incumbent Malcolm Turnbull in a party leadership vote, winning 42 votes to Mr Turnbull's 41. Many pundits were shocked by the result, given Mr Abbott's gaffe-prone history. As leader of the opposition, Mr Abbott's aggressive approach earned him several nicknames. His tactics led some to call him ""Tear-down Tony"" or ""Mad Monk"" - a reference to his time spent training as a priest. He has also consistently voted against relaxing laws on abortion, same-sex marriages and stem cell research. His stance on social issues, and his poor polling among women, has led some to say that Mr Abbott has a ""women problem"". In October 2012, Ms Gillard's blistering speech in parliament accusing him of misogyny went viral online. He took on Labor's Kevin Rudd - who ousted Ms Gillard as Labor leader - in the September 2013 polls and secured a convincing win.

They say the call is likely to have evolved from males impersonating hunting bats and startling females. Females' shuddering response appears to allow males to locate a mate. Close examination of females' nervous systems suggested that this shudder evolved from a startle reflex, the researchers say. The findings are published in the journal Current Biology. Lead researcher Prof Hannah ter Hofstede investigated this unusual insect duet after a colleague presented some recordings of the insects' particularly high frequency chirps. ""It struck me as very strange that these crickets would use such high frequencies for mating purposes,"" the scientists said. Other cricket species avoid sounds at these frequencies, which are similar to the sounds that bats make when navigating and hunting. Prof ter Hofstede used playback experiments - playing males' songs through speakers - to test females' reaction to the high, bat-like chirps. ""I expected the females to walk to the speaker, because this is the usual behaviour for female crickets, but they did not do this - [they instead] made a small jerking motion after each male call,"" she explained.

Further study revealed that the male calls also triggered activity in a nerve cell known to be responsible for triggering escape behaviour in crickets.

Cathcart was one of several players on the receiving end of tough tackles. Visiting keeper Michael McGovern made some fine saves while Kyle Lafferty had a penalty claim turned down. Lafferty felt his shot had been blocked by Peter Pekarik's arm, but referee Marian Radu Petrescu did not see it as a spot-kick. Robert Mak came the closest to scoring for the hosts only to be denied by Hamilton stopper McGovern who was quickly off his line, while Martin Skrtel almost scored a late own goal following a Paddy McNair cross. The Liverpool defender diverted McNair's driven cross towards his own goal, and keeper Matus Kozacik was forced into a save. Northern Ireland open their Euro campaign on 12 June against Poland in Nice, the day after Slovakia meet Wales in Bordeaux. One of Northern Ireland manager Michael O'Neill's chief concerns was to see his players come through unscathed with the opening Euro 2016 game against Poland just eight days away. Worryingly for him, several key men were on the receiving end of some hefty challenges. Media playback is not supported on this device Gareth McAuley and Jonny Evans picked up minor knocks before the other man in the back three, Watford defender Cathcart, had to limp off after being fouled. That led to 36-year-old Hughes coming on to win his 100th cap as a 30th-minute substitute. It had been expected the former Newcastle and Aston Villa man would come one at some point for his landmark appearance, but O'Neill was forced to make the change earlier than planned. As well as Cathcart, O'Neill will await a fitness update on striker Lafferty who came off in the second half with a leg injury. Manager O'Neill deployed his favoured 3-5-2 formation, setting the team up in the way he will want them to play against Poland. Paddy McNair caught the eye again in a wide role on the right while Millwall's Shane Ferguson came into the team to stake his claim for a starting role in Nice.

""Since the plans for the mine were unveiled in 2007, we have lived with this constant threat, which has taken over the lives of every individual and the community as a whole,"" says Mrs Schulz-Hopfner. How American energy independence could change the world Shale industry faces reality check ""Every single decision we make is affected by it."" And the residents of Atterwasch are not alone. In the eastern German region of Lausitz, nine villages are under threat, where up to 3,000 people could lose their homes to make way for five new lignite mines that are fuelling the country's renewed thirst for coal. Two further mines are under consideration. The mines are needed to power a new generation of coal power plants. Two new lignite plants were opened in 2012, with a further two in the pipeline. Another two hard coal plants also opened last year, with a further five opening this year or next, with two more awaiting licences. The effects are already being felt. Lignite production in 2012 hit its highest level for almost 20 years, while initial estimates suggest this brown coal was used to generate 162bn kWh of electricity last year, more than in any year since 1990. The use of hard coal also increased, meaning the two energy sources accounted for 46% of Germany's overall energy production. The impact on CO2 emissions has been immediate. ""There has been an increase of between 5%-7% in CO2 in the past two years,"" says Prof Claudia Kemfert, head of energy at the German Institute for Economic Research. And this in a country that aims to reduce emissions by 40% from 1990 levels by 2020. As Prof Christian Hey, secretary general of the German Advisory Council for the Environment, says: ""Germany has a coal problem."" There are many reasons why. One is the low cost of carbon.

Its public stance has been that:  ""Governments make tax law, the tax authorities independently enforce the law, and Google complies with the law."" In which case, the authorities in the UK and beyond seem to be concluding that what's required is a change in the law. Chancellor George Osborne has already instigated a clampdown on the way multinationals shift their profits to different jurisdictions to pay less tax, known as the ""diverted profits tax"". HMRC has said that the new tax, which came into effect in April last year, is aimed at capturing tax from organisations that don't pay corporation tax on their profits in the UK. Google, says HMRC, has paid the taxes that it is supposed to pay. Which, say critics, suggests this new tax doesn't go far enough. Last month, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) successfully brokered an agreement designed to improve the current system. All 31 of its member countries, which include the US, Bermuda and Guernsey, have agreed to share information on the tax international firms pay, leaving them less room for moving their profits into low tax jurisdictions. But the plan would still require implementation at national level. At the heart of the agreement is the concept of transparency, in particular what is known as ""country-by-country reporting"". This would force companies to tell the tax office of each country in which they operate, how many staff they employ there, what their revenues and profit are and how much tax they pay. The European Commission has proposed EU member states do the same.  If its plan is approved, which experts say is unlikely as any direct tax measures require unanimity, it could eventually be turned into law by individual countries. The Commission has said it is also looking separately at whether these accounts should be opened up to public scrutiny and will publish its findings in the spring.

It showed most trusts did not increase their charges, but the average rise among the third that did was 15%. The analysis combines figures obtained from NHS trusts and data submitted to statistics body NHS Digital. The most expensive trust in the country for a one-hour stay is the Royal Surrey County Hospital in Guildford, where patients are forced to pay í‰Œ£4 for any stay up to two hours. Deputy chief executive Alf Turner said the charge was necessary to cover running costs and fund the expansion of the car park that is taking place. ""I do not like having to charge people for car parking and in an ideal world we would not have to,"" he added. At the other end of the scale, car parking at Trafford General Hospital in Greater Manchester is free for up to three hours. Some trusts allow patients and visitors to park for free for the first 30 minutes before charges start. But others have scrapped cheaper charges for short stays, meaning people have to pay a flat fee covering up to three hours even if they are only staying for 45 minutes. Of the 209 hospital trusts that reported figures to NHS Digital for both 2014/15 and 2015/16, a third showed an increase in their average charge for a three-hour stay. Some 60% showed no change over the year, while 7% showed a decrease. Some 38% also said they also charged for disabled parking.

OECD secretary-general Angel Gurria said: ""International tax rules, many of them dating from the 1920s, ensure that businesses don't pay taxes in two countries - double taxation. By Andrew WalkerBBC World Service Economics correspondent It's a plan to produce a plan. At a time when there's much controversy about corporate tax, the OECD has certainly succeeded in grabbing the headlines. But will it produce any real results? There is significant political support for the idea of a crackdown on tax evasion and avoidance. The British Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne and several other European finance ministers have been pushing this agenda. In the United States there is political capital to be earned by being tough on multinationals. Nonetheless, the OECD still has to come up with the detailed proposals and then governments have to choose to implement them. Some probably will be co-operative. But the OECD has no power to compel those who are not. ""This is laudable, but unfortunately these rules are now being abused to permit double non-taxation."" It is calling for greater international co-operation to close gaps that allows income to ""disappear"" for tax purposes. The OECD also said that tax income should reflect the economic activity it generates. That would address some of the criticism aimed at big companies. Earlier this year, Google was fiercely criticised by UK MPs for routing í€äó_í‰Œ£3.2bn of UK sales through Dublin and paying little tax as a result. Starbucks has been questioned for transferring money to a Dutch sister company in royalty payments. And Apple's chief executive Tim Cook was questioned by US lawmakers about the billions of dollars his company keeps in its Irish divisions. The companies point out that these schemes are legal and they have a duty to their shareholders to minimise their tax bills.

Ms Hollands, a mother of three, went to Darent Valley Hospital complaining of breathing difficulties and chest and stomach pain. She had suffered an ectopic pregnancy three weeks earlier. Gravesend Coroner's Court heard the former drug user was taking methadone to treat her addiction, but had stopped for a few days. Ms Hollands was given an electrocardiogram (ECG) and methadone, and was given her discharge papers. Her former partner Carl Alleyne said she was in pain and not breathing properly, but was told the hospital ""needed the bed space"". He refused to take her home and she died a few hours later from a blockage in the artery carrying blood from the heart to the lungs.

""It is time for us all to draw a line in the sand and move towards peace, co-operation, love and healing."" 'Mutual suspicions' Katherine Jackson was on a 10-day spa trip to Arizona, when speculation arose about her whereabouts and her health. Prince Michael, 15, Paris, 14, and 10-year-old Prince Michael II (also called Blanket) have lived with the singer's mother since his death in 2009. Lawyers for the estate this week confirmed a number of unnamed relatives have been barred from visiting the Jackson family home. Writing in his statement about the confrontation at the Jackson family home on 23 July, Jermaine said ""it was clear that mutual suspicions had allowed events to spiral out of control"". ""I regret that events were ever allowed to reach such a stage,"" he wrote. ""I regret any distress caused to Prince, Paris and Blanket. That was never, ever the intention of myself, Janet, Rebbie or Randy."" Michael Jackson's will left nothing to his siblings when he died aged 50 of an overdose of the anaesthetic propofol in June 2009. 'Overwhelmed' Janet, Randy, Jermaine and Rebbie are all understood to have signed a letter, which was leaked to the press, alleging the will was a fake and calling on executors of the estate to resign. The letter states the family was too overwhelmed at the time of the singer's death to meaningfully challenge the will that gave only Katherine Jackson and Michael's three children a stake in the estate. The estate has denied the accusations, saying they are ""saddened"" by ""false and defamatory accusations"".

As far as I'm concerned, it has nothing to do with politics,"" he added. Khodorkovsky has not yet decided whether he wants to stay permanently in Switzerland, his spokesman said. The businessman made his fortune from the controversial privatisation of Soviet state assets. In 1995, he acquired oil giant Yukos. After President Vladimir Putin came to power Khodorkovsky made no secret of his support for the liberal opposition, In 2005 he received an eight-year jail sentence for tax evasion, fraud and embezzlement. Two years before his release date he was convicted again on further charges of embezzlement and money laundering. He had been due to be released next August, but requested a pardon because his mother is suffering from cancer. The pardon came after Russian MPs backed a wide-ranging amnesty for at least 20,000 prisoners. Two members of punk protest band Pussy Riot - jailed for staging a protest in a cathedral - have also recently been freed.

Particularly as only four of the 17 posts were contested - although that may be because most of Corbyn's Labour allies already have roles as shadow ministers. Former shadow chancellor Chris Leslie, who has said Mr  Corbyn's economic policy would result in ""higher inflation and higher cost of living"" which would hit ""the very people we should be standing up for"", will chair the Parliamentary Party's Treasury committee.

The conflict and a blockade imposed by the coalition have also triggered a humanitarian disaster, leaving 80% of the population in need of aid. The conflict has its roots in the failure of the political transition that was supposed to bring stability to Yemen following an uprising that forced its longtime authoritarian president, Ali Abdullah Saleh, to hand over power to Mr Hadi, his deputy, in November 2011. Mr Hadi struggled to deal with a variety of problems, including attacks by al-Qaeda, a separatist movement in the south, the continuing loyalty of many military officers to Mr Saleh, as well as corruption, unemployment and food insecurity. The Houthi movement, which champions Yemen's Zaidi Shia Muslim minority and fought a series of rebellions against Mr Saleh during the previous decade, took advantage of the new president's weakness by taking control of their northern heartland of Saada province and neighbouring areas. Disillusioned with the transition, many ordinary Yemenis - including Sunnis - supported the Houthis and in September 2014 they entered the capital, Sanaa, setting up street camps and roadblocks. In January 2015, the Houthis reinforced their takeover of Sanaa, surrounding the presidential palace and other key points and effectively placing Mr Hadi and his cabinet ministers under house arrest. The president escaped to the southern port city of Aden the following month. The Houthis and security forces loyal to Mr Saleh then attempted to take control of the entire country, forcing Mr Hadi to flee abroad in March 2015. Alarmed by the rise of a group they believed to be backed militarily by regional Shia power Iran, Saudi Arabia and eight other mostly Sunni Arab states began an air campaign aimed at restoring Mr Hadi's government.

Dale Stephens' volley after the break doubled the lead before Rovers' Sam Gallagher fired in from close range. Brighton substitute Glenn Murray chipped in to seal the win after Blackburn's Gordon Greer was sent off, before Gallagher grabbed a consolation. Murray's 13th league goal of the season and first away from home this campaign, came after Rovers goalkeeper Jason Steele dropped Lewis Dunk's shot at the striker's feet. Any chance of a comeback by the hosts had already been made more difficult at 2-1, when ex-Brighton captain Greer was shown a second yellow for a foul on Bournemouth loanee Murray 16 minutes from full-time. Gallagher smashed in his ninth Championship goal this season and second of the evening after racing clear in stoppage time, but it was too late for Owen Coyle's struggling side in front of a season-low crowd of 9,976 at Ewood Park. Rovers have now lost 11 of their 21 Championship fixtures and Cardiff's win over Wolves ensured they slipped into the relegation zone. In contrast, Brighton have been defeated in just seven of their past 68 league games in a run stretching back to May 2015, but will be replaced by Newcastle at the summit if the Magpies win at Wigan on Wednesday. Duffy, who arrived on the south coast in August, has now scored four times against Rovers this season - three of them own goals. The 24-year-old turned into his own net in a 3-0 defeat at Wigan on 13 August. Four days later Duffy scored two first-half own goals and was then sent off in stoppage time in a 2-1 loss at Cardiff - his final league match for the Lancashire club. Blackburn manager Owen Coyle told BBC Radio Lancashire: ""I thought we started the game really well on the front foot against a team I would say along with Newcastle look very, very big favourites certainly for automatic promotion.

They were left to die there rather than being buried. Many experts have argued that conflict only came about as humans became more settled. These people, by contrast, were apparently nomadic hunter-gatherers. The archaeologists, who have been working on the site at Nataruk since 2012, discovered that the victims were clubbed or stabbed to death in a single event. The dead included male and female adults, as well as children. The evidence, published in the journal Nature, does not reveal exactly what happened but the fact that so many people died at the same time suggests it was the result of ""some sort of conflict"", according to Cambridge University Professor Robert Foley. Nataruk records what is, for now, the oldest scientifically-dated case of conflict between two nomadic hunter-gatherer groups. Nevertheless, its significance is not its age, but the fact that it involved these groups, who had few possessions to fight over. Nataruk establishes definitively that inter-group violence can and did arise regardless of whether the populations were settled. All it needed was moments of food abundance, causing groups to grow in size, putting pressure on the resources. Then the benefits of stealing from another group could outweigh the costs of the conflict that might ensue. Nataruk was an important place because it was at the edge of a super lake beach which would have attracted all land animals to drink, as well as giving access to fishing grounds, while other parts of the shore of Lake Turkana (the forested Kerio Delta, for example, or the rocky whole southern edge) would not have that.

Judge David Harris said he was not convinced that Ms Krajnc obstructed the use of property when she gave water to pigs headed to slaughter. Ms Krajnc said it confirms ""compassion is not a crime"". Mischief to property is a criminal offence in Canada related to the wilful destruction or damage of property. Justice Harris wrote in his decision that he is satisfied that Ms Krajnc ""did not obstruct, interrupt or interfere with the lawful use, enjoyment or operation of any property"" when in July 2015, she gave water to a few animals being carried in a tractor trailer filled with 190 pigs going to a slaughterhouse outside Toronto. Ms Krajnc, who co-founded an organisation called Toronto Pig Save in 2011, regularly gathered with other activists on a traffic island at an intersection near a large slaughterhouse to pet the animals and give them water. But this time, the truck driver confronted Ms Krajnc and police were called. A video of the tense encounter was posted online by the activists. During her trial, supporters crammed into the courtroom, many sitting on the floor. Members of the media sat in the prisoner's box.

Shaw claimed that he had had consensual sex with the girl once she turned 16, but the jury did not believe him. In evidence, his victims said he ruined their childhoods. One of them said: ""He said if we ever told what had happened to us we would be taken away from our families."" The jail term was welcomed by NSPCC Scotland which praised Shaw's victims for coming forward to report his ""heinous"" crimes. A spokesman for the charity said: ""This sentence sends out the strong message once again that child abuse will not be tolerated, no matter when the offences took place, and we hope this case will encourage others to speak out about abuse they have suffered, knowing they will be listened to and supported.""",ADD ERROR,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,,TRUE,FALSE,Extrinsic entity error (Entity does not appear in article or gold summary),Extrinsic entity error (Entity does not appear in article or gold summary),,,,

It said there was complacency about the impact of rapid population growth which it said ""could change the UK forever"". Remain said leaving the EU and damaging the economy was not the answer. Immigration has been a key battleground in the referendum campaign ahead of the vote on EU membership on 23 June. Net migration to the UK rose to 333,000 in 2015, according to Office for National Statistics estimates released in May - the second highest figure on record - figures which the Leave campaign argue illustrates the inability of the UK to control migration while being in the EU. Migration Watch, which campaigns for reduced migration, has now looked over a 20-year period at the impact on net migration in the event the UK votes to remain in the EU on 23 June. This issue covers immigration and free movement within Europe. Net migration is the difference between the number of people coming to the UK for at least a year and those leaving. It said the figure of 265,000 excluded the possibility of Turkey joining the EU altogether and took the average of the high and low migration scenarios. Under its low migration scenario, net migration from the EU would fall to 135,000 by the end of the period and only a small number of refugees who have already arrived in other parts of the EU would relocate to Britain. In this scenario the government would successfully reduce non-EU net migration to 100,000 a year and British emigration would remain at 50,000 a year, leading to total net migration of 205,000. For the high scenario, net migration from the EU would rise to 220,000 by 2031. In this scenario, non-EU migration would remain at 150,000 per year and British emigration would remain at 50,000 net per year, leading to net migration to the UK to 320,000 in 20 years' time, it said. Lord Green of Deddington, chairman of Migration Watch UK said: ""This report is a final wake-up call. Even leaving aside the prospect of Turkey joining the EU, it shows that net migration could still be running at 265,000 a year in 20 years' time.

The debate over coalition deals has arisen because polling suggests neither Labour nor the Conservatives would gain an overall majority in this year's election. If that is the case a coalition deal with smaller parties could be possible or a so-called ""confidence and supply"" arrangement could be agreed whereby the smaller party supports the larger party in key votes. During the webchat Mr Murphy was also asked about tuition fees, the Scottish independence referendum and his decision to fight his East Renfrewshire seat in May.",ADD ERROR,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,,TRUE,FALSE,Extrinsic entity error (Entity does not appear in article or gold summary),,,,,

Well, almost all. The ""dress code"" memo must have gone into Pharrell's junk email inbox, because he turned up wearing a green baseball cap and grey sweater. To be fair - the sweater does have the Nasa logo on it, a reference to best picture nominee Hidden Figures.

In Australia, he highlighted some cases where the authorities had failed to provide adequate detention conditions, end the detention of children, or prevent escalating violence and tension at Manus Island.

China is one of the biggest markets for WoW. The Chinese are estimated to make up about half of its five million players. One of the studios behind the movie, Legendary Entertainment, is majority owned by Chinese conglomerate Dalian Wanda, which acquired a controlling stake in January. But the decision is also part of an accelerating trend where Hollywood has been wooing China by staging elaborate premieres and tie-ups. The last Transformers movie was partly funded by Chinese backers and shot in China - though that ran into controversy - and the latest Star Wars movie was heavily promoted in China with publicity stunts and the appointment of pop star Luhan as an ambassador. The love story between China and WoW is one of perseverance, as the game's popularity has soared despite deep government suspicion prompting heavy controls, according to tech blog Engadget. Chinese players had to make do with a special version of the game with its violence, gore and even character design toned down. Skeletons were ""covered up"" with flesh, and even the colour of spilt blood was changed to a darker, less shocking hue. The government also insisted that a timer mechanism be built into the game to prevent people from playing it for too long, following widespread fears of internet addiction. Last year one WoW player reportedly collapsed and died after playing it for 19 hours without a break. Operation of the game in China was originally in foreign hands, but it eventually was bought over by Chinese company NetEase. But such obstacles could not stop its runaway success - part of the reason was the timing, as the game was first introduced China in 2005, at a time where online access and internet cafes were fast proliferating amid a booming tech scene. In a nod to its popularity, creator Blizzard Entertainment made a Chinese-inspired expansion to the game called Mists of Pandaria in 2012, featuring panda warriors and monk characters.

Clubs so often happy to leave United with a narrow defeat have boarded their respective team buses with landmark victories, domestic cup hopes have ended and, after midweek defeat at Olympiakos, the Red Devils' European dreams are on the same path. Moyes put his head in his hands as Robin van Persie ballooned a late chance over the bar in Greece. In truth, supporters could be forgiven for having done the same at a far earlier stage, such was the latest bland offering in a season in which one disappointment has quickly followed another. I still believe Moyes is the man to lead United in what would always be a tricky post-Sir Alex Ferguson era. What I did not expect was for so much to go wrong so quickly. Here are 10 Moyes mistakes at Manchester United: One moment which stood out to me was his admission he did not substitute Robin van Persie in the home defeat by Newcastle because of the potential reaction from supporters. So what? He would have made the change at Everton. He was once fearless, but suddenly fearful. Fearful of a backlash. Moyes should not care about what others think because he is at United because of his ability. He is good enough. He was the man chosen and now he has to believe in himself. I have spent time with him and he is a passionate, hard-working man, but that will count for little if he does not start believing in himself a bit more. This, I thought, would change. He was criticised at Everton for not beating the big clubs and, this season, in the head-to-head table of the league's top seven clubs, United sit bottom. They have just one win in nine games against those sides and five defeats. It just is not good enough for a United team. Moyes carries an inferiority in the big games and it is a big question mark.

The government says it is simply removing the ""spare room subsidy"" which put social sector tenants in a better position than those in the private rental sector. Ministers argue the changes will encourage people to downsize to smaller properties, and in doing so,  help cut the í‰Œ£23bn annual bill for housing benefit, free up living space for overcrowded families, and encourage people to get jobs. But housing charities have warned that the result will be higher levels of rent arrears and greater homelessness. The government estimates that over half a million tenants are affected by the new rules, which took effect in April this year. More than half of those affected have a disability causing them ""significant difficulty in one or more areas of the individual's life"", the Department for Work and Pensions has said. The government predicts that savings to the taxpayer will amount to í‰Œ£505m in 2013-14, and í‰Œ£540m in the year after. What has changed? The new rules affect housing benefit, which is paid to less well-off tenants to help with rent. Typically claimants receive between í‰Œ£50 and í‰Œ£100 a week. But since April 2013 families deemed to have too much living space by their local authorities receive a reduced payment.  Under the government's so-called ""size criteria"", families are assessed for the number of bedrooms they actually need. Who is affected? This change affects council tenants, and those who rent from housing associations, who are housing benefit claimants. It does not affect private sector tenants who are already subject to certain rules. The government estimates that 660,000 households will have their benefit cut, roughly a third of social sector claimants. Only those of working age will see reduced payments. But there are some other exemptions too. Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith said the 5,000 approved foster carers in the UK would continue to receive rent payments towards an ""additional room"" as long as they have fostered a child or become an approved foster carer in the previous 12 months. And families with adult children serving in the armed forces will also be exempt from the changes, even when they are on overseas deployment.

The English Football League fixtures will be released on Wednesday, 21 June, and Scotland's fixtures two days later. Questions have been raised about Tottenham's potential to perform at Wembley after a miserable run of results there in last season's Champions League, and Mauricio Pochettino's side will have a tough first test at their temporary home. The last time Spurs visited the national stadium was in the FA Cup semi-final, a game they lost 4-2 to this season's first visitors - Chelsea. But it could prove a tricky opening few weeks for the defending champions too, with Chelsea hosting Everton (26 August), visiting 2015-16 winners Leicester after the international break and then welcoming Arsenal (16 September). Arsene Wenger's Gunners have a chance to show their top-four credentials in week three when they visit Liverpool. Another early indicator in the race for the Champions League places comes in the following round of games, with Liverpool travelling to Etihad Stadium to face Manchester City. Europa League winners Manchester United do not face another Champions League qualifier until they visit Jurgen Klopp's Liverpool on the weekend of 14-15 October. English football's top-flight sides will face four league games in nine days over Christmas and new year, with eight in total from 2 December to 1 January. The final round of the Champions League group stage also takes place during that period, as traditionally does the fifth round of the League Cup. Arsenal welcome Liverpool two days before Christmas, while Brighton go to Chelsea on Boxing Day and Newcastle host Manchester City. West Ham make the trip across London to face Tottenham in the round of games scheduled for 30 December, with another London derby taking place on New Year's Day as Arsenal host Chelsea. There will be no easing into life in the top flight for those promoted from the Championship, with Brighton's first game in the Premier League at home to Pep Guardiola's Manchester City.",ADD ERROR,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,,TRUE,FALSE,"Intrinsic entity error (Entity appears in article or gold summary, but is not used correctly in suggested summary)",Extrinsic entity error (Entity does not appear in article or gold summary),,,,

The behaviour of Mrs Merkel, in forcing the Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras against his wishes to accept future IMF involvement in the bailout, suggests she believes IMF endorsement and involvement is the sine qua non of Bundestag approval. And if the Bundestag says ""Nein"", we are back in the territory of Greece careering towards the euro door marked exit and penury. Second, if the IMF is saying - as it effectively does in its debt sustainability update - that Greece is insolvent without a massive debt write-off, and a write-off that eurozone governments show no sign of embracing, can the European Central Bank in good conscience increase emergency lending to banks, or Emergency Liquidity Assistance? Now Greek banks have been led to believe by the Bank of Greece that the ECB would increase ELA by around 2bn euros either today or tomorrow. If this happens, it will be a significant fillip to the Greek economy. Because the banks are planning to re-open their doors in those circumstances - either tomorrow (now unlikely) or Monday. It would not be banking and business as usual. But some of the economically devastating effects of capital controls - most of which would be retained - would be limited. Here is what the banks will do if the ECB provides just a bit more emergency lending. First, the government committee currently approving - or more accurately not approving - requests by businesses for the banks to finance imports would have its powers transferred back to the banks. Subject to rules, the banks would then start to provide finance again to companies wanting to import goods and raw materials deemed vital to Greece's economic interests. Which means the twin dangers would recede of the economy grinding to a halt for want of imports and of a humanitarian crisis caused by a shortage of medicines and foods. Second, cashiers would start to receive cheques again, and people could withdraw their maximum of 60 euros per account over the counter, and not just at cash machines. To be clear, the 60 euro limit on withdrawals would remain, perhaps for months. And transferring money abroad would remain heavily restricted.

Ms Lockhart also confirmed a DUP statement which said she had a relative in the non-domestic scheme. In December, Sinn Fí€Œ©in said PAC committee member Michelle Gildernew MLA had a brother in the domestic scheme. Mrs Gildernew was absent from the committee on Wednesday. The PAC has been running an investigation into the handling of the non-domestic RHI for several months. The green energy scheme was intended to increase the creation of heat from renewable sources. However, businesses were receiving more in subsidies than they were paying for renewable fuel and the scheme became majorly oversubscribed. The fallout from the scandal surrounding the scheme, which is approximately í‰Œ£490m over budget, resulted in the collapse of Stormont's institutions and the calling of snap elections on 2 March. Mrs Lockhart told the committee on Wednesday her brother-in-law had been a recipient of the heat subsidy since 2014, but she had been unaware of that fact until January 2017. She was responding to a request from UUP MLA and committee chair Robin Swann for any committee member with an interest in the scheme to declare it. Mrs Lockhart said as well as being unaware of her relative's involvement with RHI, she did not ""help or assist with the application process"". ""My mother and father have poultry farms and do not have RHI and I can let any journalist see my bank statements and they will see there's no benefit from RHI,"" she said. Mrs Lockhart said it would be useful to know whether any committee member absent from today's meeting had any interest in the RHI scheme. The chairman said he would ask the committee clerk to write to all its members seeking the information which would be circulated to all the other members. DUP MLA Trevor Clarke asked whether this would cover any relative including one ""three times removed"". Mr Swann went on to thank members for their work on the inquiry. He said they'd managed to remain ""apolitical"" and had done ""sterling work"". He said the work was now in the hands of the upcoming public inquiry.

However, Jonathan Mitchell QC, representing the petitioners, later told the court that his clients believed that Mr Carmichael leaked the information to deliberately smear the SNP. The court heard that this was to reduce the chances of a Scottish National Party candidate being elected in Orkney and Shetland. The case, believed to be the first of its kind in Scotland for 50 years, arose from remarks made by Mr Carmichael at the start of the general election campaign in April. The MP, who had been Scottish Secretary in the Tory-Lib Dem coalition before the election, authorised leaking a civil service memo suggesting the first minister had told the French ambassador she backed Tory PM David Cameron to remain in Downing Street. Mr Carmichael had initially denied leaking the confidential memo to the Daily Telegraph. He claimed the first he had heard of it was when he received a phone call from a journalist.

He stressed that a false statement of fact must be ""directly related"" to the personal character or conduct of a candidate. Ms Sturgeon, the leader of the SNP and Scotland's first minister, was not a candidate in May's general election. The QC said it would have been the ""easiest thing in the world"" for the Act to make it clear if a false statement could be about non-candidates. He also said attacking the political position of a candidate did not necessarily attack their character.

""I'm open to suggestions from people - how would you control it?"" added Donald. ""If you've got 500-600 people in a contained environment and they're hell-bent on setting a flare off, you would need to have a steward for every three or four spectators to stop that, and that's never going to happen. ""It's really regrettable and it's something that is happening more and more often. It's a wider problem that's becoming far too prevalent."" Linlithgow Rose manager David McGlynn said the club would try to track down those responsible for throwing the smoke bombs, while club president Les Donaldson attempted to challenge the perpetrators at Station Park. ""It's just shocking to think that a club who has tried so hard to go forward, to make facilities so good for every person who comes along to eventually be brought down by a bunch of hooligans who have no interest whatsoever in watching football, all they were there for was causing trouble,"" Donaldson told BBC Radio Scotland on Wednesday.

His administration had accused the police of failing to deal with an alleged drugs and prostitution ring - something they denied. The chief minister says he has won concessions from central government. By Soutik BiswasIndia correspondent India's Arvind Kejriwal's 'anarchic' politics The government, which commands Delhi's police force, has agreed to send on leave two police officers Mr Kejriwal wants suspended on allegations of misconduct. ""I'm very happy today. Today the people of Delhi have won. I want to congratulate the people of Delhi,"" AFP news agency quotes Mr Kejriwal as telling supporters. The protest began on Monday when Mr Kejriwal was prevented from going to the home minister's office to demand the officers' suspension. He was acting in response to an incident which threatened to become a diplomatic issue, putting his Aam Aadmi Party, the police and members of Delhi's African community at loggerheads. Last Wednesday Mr Kejriwal's Law Minister, Somnath Bharti, and various party supporters allegedly confronted four Ugandan women in a Delhi neighbourhood, accusing them of prostitution. Police refused to search a nearby house for evidence of the suspected drugs and prostitution ring because they did not have a warrant. Mr Bharti and supporters of the Aam Aadmi Party were accused of threatening and intimidating the women, forcing their way into homes and making racist remarks - allegations they deny. Mr Kejriwal's wider demands include police reform and transferring control of Delhi's police force from the federal authorities. The chief minister also accuses the police of failing to protect women, following the fatal gang-rape of a student in December 2012. The Aam Aadmi Party, or Common Man's Party, performed unexpectedly well in state elections on an anti-corruption platform, propelling Mr Kejriwal to the post of chief minister last month. India's general election must take place by May and the party, only one year old, is expected to field a large number of candidates. The protest in Delhi is thought likely to raise its profile as the national poll approaches. While hailed as a victory by some, Mr Kejriwal's protest has been criticised by others, who urged him to get off the streets in order to govern as he was elected to do.
