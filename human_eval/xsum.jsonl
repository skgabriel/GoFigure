We were getting used to life on the boat. \"But the sea conditions were quite rough and worsening. \"Then late in the second day, out at sea, we started realising that water was permeating into the cabin. \"It just got worse and worse.\" The crew used an electric bilge pump to keep the problem at bay but the water kept coming in. Water eventually got into all the internal lockers and the boat was so low in the water that waves were crashing over it continuously, Mr Collins said. \"The boat had been through severe testing but in some places it was permeating through the side of the boat because of the force of the waves,\" he added. The team called for assistance and a support boat reached them 10 hours later. But with waves of 20ft (6m) and gale-force winds, it was decided that the safest rescue was by coastguard helicopter.

Mrs Fiorina dropped out of the presidential race after a poor showing at the New Hampshire primary. She has been an active supporter for Mr Cruz, a senator from Texas, on the campaign trail. The early announcement is unusual because vice-presidential picks are not normally decided until after a candidate secures the nomination. \"Over and over again, Carly has shattered glass ceilings,\" Mr Cruz said. He doesn't have the Republican nomination. He doesn't even have the lead for the nomination. In fact, he has no clear path to the nomination. But it looks like Ted Cruz will have a running mate. Naming Carly Fiorina as his vice-presidential pick at this point provides Mr Cruz with several benefits. First, he can generate some positive press and at least partially move on from the drubbing he received at the hands of Donald Trump in Tuesday's mid-Atlantic primaries. Second, he positions his campaign to make a strong play for that grand prize on the horizon, the California primary on 7 June - a battleground that could decide whether Mr Trump secures the Republican nomination without a convention fight. While Mrs Fiorina's 2010 general-election bid for a Senate seat there was spectacularly unsuccessful, she did win her party's nomination and is a known quantity among the state's conservative voters. Mr Cruz has his back to the wall. He needs a win in Indiana, and he really needs a strong performance in California. Mrs Fiorina on the ticket could help - and at this point, anything that might work is worth a shot.

This is expected to cost up to \u00c2\u0092\u00c3\u00a4\u00c3\u008e\u00c2\u00a380m. Some pupils would be tested for academic ability but the scheme would not just target the brightest children. Chief inspector of schools Sir Michael Wilshaw said the plan was not enough. The proposal, originally seen by the BBC and now confirmed, will be made in the ISC's response to a government consultation on the future of education. The scheme would be open to primary and secondary school-age children. But details about which families would benefit and what form the tests would take are yet to be settled and the scheme could not take place without the government's approval. Currently it costs an average of \u00c2\u0092\u00c3\u00a4\u00c3\u008e\u00c2\u00a330,000 to send a pupil to board and \u00c2\u0092\u00c3\u00a4\u00c3\u008e\u00c2\u00a315,500 for a day school for a year.

This status saves independent schools at least \u00c2\u0092\u00c3\u00a4\u00c3\u008e\u00c2\u00a3150m a year. But Sir Michael said the proposal did not go far enough, adding: \"I think they can do better than that and if I was government I would be asking them to do more as a quid pro quo for their tax privileges.\" There are roughly 600,000 pupils in each year group in England, and private schools educate only 7% of the total school population. Analysis By BBC education correspondent Sean Coughlan If the debate about bringing back grammar schools felt like a blast from the past, then the proposal for state-subsidised places in private schools is another case of \"back to the future\". It would mean reviving something similar to the Assisted Places Scheme, which supported means-tested places in private schools in the 1980s and 1990s. They were not \"free\" places, but taxpayer-funded. Scrapping this scheme was one of the first symbolic acts of the Blair government in 1997. Labour argued that public money should be focused on improving state education for the majority - and not used for life rafts into the private sector for a minority. But now the independent schools are testing the water with the May government. It's an ideological choice as much as a practical\n", "summary": "A new scheme has been launched in England to improve the quality of public schools.<br/>", "label": "factually incorrect", "errors": ["Intrinsic entity error"]}

Kaushal Silva was the sole wicket to fall, lbw to James Anderson, before play was called off at 17:10 BST. A five-match one-day series starts on 21 June, followed by a Twenty20.

Media playback is not supported on this device For all England's frustration at the weather on Monday, they can take credit for the efficient manner in which they completed a 2-0 series win over an inexperienced Sri Lanka side exposed by early summer conditions. Jonny Bairstow's return of 387 runs was 95 more than the next best batsman and cemented his place in the middle order, while Alex Hales took a sizeable step towards securing the opener's berth by averaging 58. But England's success was founded on the potency of their attack, led brilliantly by James Anderson with 21 wickets at less than 11 apiece. Stuart Broad's haul of 12 wickets was bettered only by Anderson, Chris Woakes produced his Test best with bat and ball after replacing the injured Ben Stokes, and Steven Finn hinted at a welcome return to form at Lord's. England may hold all but one of the nine trophies on offer against countries in bilateral series, but there remain grounds for concern for coach Trevor Bayliss. Their top-order collapses are still to be eradicated - they have lost their first four wickets before reaching 100 five times in the past seven innings. The search for a reliable number three goes on after Nick Compton managed only 51 runs in five innings, and it remains to be seen whether James Vince, who scored only 54 runs at 13.5, will be retained at number five for the Pakistan series later this summer. Despite taking 19 catches - a record for an England wicketkeeper in a three-Test series - Bairstow's glovework has been heavily criticised thanks to three drops and a missed stumping.

The fall in sales success to this dominant market, McLaren points out, has real implications for prosperity and jobs. Exports and imports, overseas and to the rUK, combined to reach a deficit in the third quarter of \u00c2\u0092\u00c3\u00a4\u00c3\u008e\u00c2\u00a34.25bn, the highest quarter on record.

The previous record was as recession struck in 2008, at just under \u00c2\u0092\u00c3\u00a4\u00c3\u008e\u00c2\u00a312bn.

But this is set to change as the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) plans to bring in new guidelines from 2018, cracking down on ads that mock people for not conforming to gender stereotypes or that reinforce gender roles. Here are some examples from the ASA of adverts it has received complaints about over gender stereotypes - but not taken action on.

However, the baby girl as depicted as growing into a ballerina. A spokesman from the ASA said complainants considered the ad portrayed negative gender stereotypes, but he added: \"We did not find grounds for a formal investigation.\" Clothing giant Gap attracted complaints after releasing adverts for its children's clothes. The boy is portrayed as a \"little scholar\" with an Albert Einstein T-shirt, promising that his \"future starts here\". However, the girl has the title of \"social butterfly\", wearing glittery cat ears and clothes that will be \"the talk of the playground\". The ASA said Gap took steps to take the ad down so it \"did not have grounds for further investigation\". A TV advert from fast food chain KFC, depicting two men arguing about the size of their new TVs, attracted complaints because of its treatment of anxiety disorders. After one character boasts how much bigger his TV is - because he is \"a man\" - he continues to mock the second man for owning scented candles. \"You know those candles help with my anxiety,\" he replies. \"You're a monster.\" The majority of complainants said the advert implied that it was acceptable to make fun of a mental health problem. A number also objected because it equated anxiety with a lack of masculinity, and helped perpetuate the damaging view that men shouldn't admit to mental health concerns. The ASA said it did not consider the advert to cause serious or widespread offence on either point, so no further action was taken.

{"article": "A study in the International Journal of Obesity found energy used at rest was 25% lower in 15-year-olds compared with when they were 10 - a fall of 500 calories a day. This is equivalent to cutting out an hour's strenuous exercise every day. The study said the findings were unexpected but could help explain why a lot of teenagers put on excess weight. Most of the energy people burn is just to keep their bodies ticking over - using the brain, heart, liver and kidneys - rather than through physical activity. In a decade-long study following 279 children, researchers from the University of Exeter Medical School were surprised to find the number of calories the children burned at rest fell sharply during puberty. This is a period of rapid growth, which usually uses up lots of calories, but it was only around the age of 16 that the number of calories burned at rest started to rise again. During puberty there was also a noticeable drop in physical exercise, particularly among girls, which could add to weight gain, the researchers said. About a third of school children aged 10-11 in England are overweight or obese. Prof Terry Wilkin, from the University of Exeter Medical School, said: \"Child obesity and associated diabetes are both among the greatest health challenges of our time. \"Our findings can explain why teenagers gain excess weight in puberty, and it could help target strategies accordingly.\" Prof Simon Capewell, vice-president of the Faculty of Public Health, said the findings showed there was an even greater need to improve children's diets and protect them from junk food and sugary drinks. \"Adolescents sitting around using their smartphones and iPads are being bombarded with junk food marketing - while using even fewer calories than we previously thought. \"Last month's government strategy on childhood obesity confirmed the duty on sugary drinks, but was otherwise a disastrous missed opportunity. \"We need much tougher regulation around the marketing of junk food to children - particularly on TV and online.\"\n", "summary": "The number of people who have a low appetite for exercise may be at its highest level in the past few years, research suggests.<br/>", "label": "factually incorrect", "errors": ["False quote"]}

{"article": "This comes after a public outcry following revelations in November that a neo-Nazi cell had apparently been able to go on a nationwide spree of racially motivated murders over several years, under the noses of the German intelligence services. The group of three are being held responsible for the deaths of eight Turkish and one Greek immigrant between 2000 and 2006, as well as a German policewoman in 2007. Yet the existence of the group, dubbed the Zwickau cell after the name of the town where they spent most of their time in hiding, only came to light in November when two of its members died in an apparent joint suicide or murder-suicide and the third handed herself in to the authorities. The NPD has been linked to the group, though the allegations have yet to be accepted in a court of law. The trio had made a DVD in which they boasted of the killings and said they had acted to serve the German nation and its people, describing themselves as the National Socialist Underground - echoing the national socialism (Nazism) of Hitler's Germany. The story of the killers has dominated headlines in Germany for months now and given rise to one of the biggest scandals in post-war Germany. It turns out intelligence agencies had had the group under surveillance for years, and even found a bomb-making factory in their garage back in 1998. So why were the trio not stopped earlier? Why were they allowed to disappear and then stay underground? And why was it that security services blamed the murders on the Turkish mafia at the time? A right-wing motive was never investigated. The failures have prompted some to ask whether there is more than incompetence to blame, whether Germany's police and security services contain elements sympathetic to the far right - an accusation the institutions vehemently deny.

Typhoo Tea produces 125 million tea bags a week at its factory in Moreton, Wirral, which have just one ingredient - tea leaves, and they are imported. Black tea is a global commodity, traded in dollars. Following the fall in sterling since the Brexit vote, costs have soared for this renowned brand as 95% of its sales are in the UK. \"This is an absolute disaster for a company the size of ours,\" says Mr Saha. \"The very sharp fall in the pound means the impact is at least a quarter of a million pounds a month for us. This is having a very negative impact on our business and we are really suffering.

There are plenty of winners from the fall in the value of sterling. But Typhoo Tea is a graphic illustration of what it's like for a business with one raw imported material. Typhoo has been trading for more than a century. These days, most of its black tea comes from Kenya. It's then blended and packaged on site. The company also packages own-label tea for most of the major supermarkets. In addition, it produces a range of herbal teas and those ingredients are sourced in euros. It's a high-volume, low-margin business. The cost of the ingredient depends on the quality of the leaf.

Two decades on, the group's influence continues to be identifiable in popular culture - and in some unexpected ways. From how TV and newspapers cover music, to the way stars brand themselves, the Spice Girls influenced many of the rules for 21st Century pop stars. Before 1996, manufactured groups were expected to obey management and music label orders. Even though the five were put together by Bob and Chris Herbert, the group soon decided to replace the father-and-son management team with Simon Fuller.  And against record company advice, they also chose their first single. \"If they decided they wanted to do something, then that's what was going to happen,\" says Wannabe's co-writer Richard \"Biff\" Stannard. Visual artist Liz West, a Guinness Book of Records entrant for the world's largest collection of Spice memorabilia (nearly 5,000 items), agrees. \"When it was suggested to people what their first single should be, they had already chosen it,\" she says. Wannabe's release came the year after the battle for chart dominance between the all-male Britpop groups Blur and Oasis. Timing was ripe for an opinionated girl group, says Paul Gorman, the first writer to interview them for Music Week. \"Britpop was a bunch of blokes going through their dads' record collections,\" he says. Wannabe's nursery-rhyme-style hypnotic chant secured a broad coalition of fans including those hard-to-get pre-teens who the music industry had previously considered as a small market. And in the following years, in the run-up to the millennium, the influence of the Spice Girls on this audience, led to the emergence of other acts aimed at a younger market. As a result, acts such as S Club 7, B*Witched, Aqua, Hanson, Steps and Billie Piper started to top the charts. Kim Glover, the manager of girlband B*Witched, who had four number one singles in the slipstream of Spice success says: \"They were very different from what had gone before them.

The American businessman wanted to build the greatest golf course on earth. However, some people who lived in the area became vehemently opposed, and the saga of the Trump International Golf Links began. \"I saw that the residents of Menie were getting a lot of bad press at a time when Donald Trump was being celebrated for arriving in the area,\" reflected Alicia Bruce, a photographer who spent six years capturing the changing landscape of Menie and its people as the course was built on rare sand dunes.

The ALMR represents leading brands, including Pizza Express, Wagamama and Yo Sushi, as well as smaller businesses operating from only one or two premises. \"We would urge you to consider reviewing the transitional relief provisions and the introduction of sector specific hospitality retail relief,\" the letter says.

But as property values change over time, rateable values need to be reassessed periodically - usually every five years. However this update to property values is two years behind schedule, making it a harder pill to swallow in areas where the price of real estate has been rising. A statement from the Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG) said that most businesses will not face sharp rises in costs. \"Following the revaluation, three-quarters of properties will see no change or even a fall in their bills, and the small minority of businesses that face an increase will benefit from our \u00c2\u0092\u00c3\u009b\u00c2\u008a\u00c2\u0097_\u00c2\u0092\u00c3\u00a4\u00c3\u008e\u00c2\u00a33.6bn transitional relief scheme,\" it said.

But the mood in the corridors of power is wretched. In a country where backbench rebellions are almost unknown, politicians contend themselves with hints of dissent in anti-government media, and more open attacks on Viktor Orban's policies in pro-government media. A new, pro-Russian foreign policy sits particularly awkwardly in a party which rose to fame in 1989 as the first to demand publicly that Soviet troops leave Hungary. It began with a photograph of Viktor Orban shaking hands with Russian President Vladimir Putin in January, after signing a highly controversial nuclear expansion deal. When the Russians annexed Crimea in March, the Budapest government criticised the beleaguered Ukrainian government in Kiev, and stated publicly that all it cared about was the Hungarian minority in western Ukraine. In July, Hungary's embassy in Estonia was closed down at a moment when the Baltic states - Hungary's Nato allies - felt under most pressure from Moscow. Mr Orban has consistently opposed EU and US sanctions against Russia, on the grounds that \"we should be doves in economic policy, and hawks in defence\". In an August speech to Hungary's ambassadors, he called openly for an unprincipled foreign policy, placing foreign investment in Hungary above any moral considerations such as a trade partner's human rights record. And in September, within an hour of Mr Orban meeting with the chief of Russia's state-owned gas giant, Gazprom, the reverse flow of gas to Ukraine in Hungary's pipelines, which had been annoying Russia, was stopped. Dismay is growing within Fidesz at his domestic policy too: at government corruption, the playboy lifestyle of numerous party officials, and an economic policy which consistently suppresses the value of the Hungarian currency, the forint.

He's then expected to be taken to a holding cell before appearing before a judge at Cape Town High Court at about 10:00. He's expected to spend the night at Valkenberg Hospital, a large psychiatric hospital on the outskirts of Cape Town. Doctors there will assess whether or not he is mentally fit to stand trial. South African authorities have 18 months to put him on trial - or return him to the UK. Cape Town ready for Dewani trial Timeline: Anni Dewani murder Mr Dewani was thrown from the car. The body of Mrs Dewani was found the next day in the abandoned taxi with a single gunshot wound to the neck. Three men have already been convicted in connection with Mrs Dewani's death. Prosecutors in South Africa allege Mr Dewani ordered the killing of his Swedish national wife. Mr Dewani's legal team still have the option of applying to the European Court of Human Rights, but so far no application has been received. The businessman, from Bristol, is expected to arrive in Cape Town on Tuesday.. Once on South African soil he is likely to appear before the Western Cape High Court where his legal team could apply for bail. If that is refused, he will be taken to the high-care wing of Valkenberg, a psychiatric facility, the BBC's Karen Schoonbee in Cape Town understands. Ashok Hindocha, Anni Dewani's uncle, told ITV's Daybreak that the family would attend the court hearing. \"We want to know what happened to Anni. That is it,\" he said. Anish Hindocha, her brother, added: \"We are just focusing on this case at the moment and it is hard to even start making the grieving process final yet because there are so many questions we need answers to. \"We hope we get it and now today he is getting extradited and that is one\n", "summary": "A British couple have allegedly been involved in an attempted murder.<br/>", "label": "factually incorrect", "errors": ["Sentiment error"]}

On Monday fire almost destroyed the 123-year-old St James Church in Brighton, while a separate fire damaged St Mary's Church in St Kilda East. The Dandenong church was one of eight Catholic churches linked to priest Kevin O'Donnell, who sexually abused children throughout his 50-year career in Melbourne parishes. Local media have reported that in 1995 O'Donnell, aged 78, pleaded guilty to indecently assaulting 10 boys and two girls, aged between eight and 15, and spent 15 months in jail. He was freed in 1996 and died in 1997. The other two churches were linked to paedophile priest Ronald Dennis Pickering, who served at various parishes in Melbourne between 1958 and 1993, before returning to his native Britain where he died in 2009. In 2013, both men were on a list released by the Australian Catholic Church of 29 Melbourne priests who it acknowledged were guilty of sexually abusing children. Police would not comment on the fires or any suspects other than to say they were all suspicious and were being investigated separately. But Regional Bishop for the Catholic Church in Victoria Peter Elliott told Fairfax Radio he did not believe the fires were linked to anger over child sexual abuse, but were instead the work of a \"very disturbed person\". The fires come as a Royal Commission into Institutional Child Sexual Abuse travels around Australia taking evidence about alleged child sex abuse linked to churches, charities and government agencies. Local media have cited research by a Melbourne university that found at least five people had killed themselves after being sexually abused by Pickering between 1960 and 1980. Hollywood actress and former St James' parishioner Rachel Griffiths said the church's destruction came as a relief because of its history. \"I was quite elated, like many of my generation, when I heard the news,\" she told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. \"It's always been a difficult building for us to drive past because there's been so much tragedy and complicated feelings, I guess,\" she said.\n", "summary": "Police in Australia have released pictures of a priest who was beaten to death by a paedophilist.<br/>", "label": "factually incorrect", "errors": ["Intrinsic entity error", "Extrinsic entity error"]}

But these superstar horses do not travel light. Each horse has an individual limit for the flight which includes its own weight plus items such as water buckets, tack bags and rugs. As well as all that food, there's nearly 10 tonnes of equipment and several tonnes of haylage (normal hay with a higher moisture content) for the flight. There will be 34 horses on board when the first flight leaves Stansted on 30 July, with a combined weight of more than 17 tonnes and a combined value running into millions of pounds.

It's also been the subject of several select committee inquiries. And it continues to vex the Conservative MP for Kettering, Philip Hollobone. Throughout his time as an MP he has raised concerns about the number of foreigners in our prisons and our failure to send them back home to serve their sentences. Now a government minister not only praised him for his campaign, but admitted that he too shares Mr Hollobone's frustration. Mike Penning, minister for policing and criminal justice, told Parliament that while being briefed by officials he was \"very surprised... about some of the things that are being done\" and found it \"mind bogglingly difficult to work out why, in many cases, things do not happen.\" He was replying to a debate called by Mr Hollobone who had come up with some new figures about the extent of the problem. There are, he told MPs, 10,837 foreign national offenders in our prisons which make up 13% of the prison population.

{"article": "What are the figures behind this? The number of police officers in England and Wales has already fallen by about 16,000 since 2010 because of cuts in Home Office funding. Labour's sums are based on assumptions about the amounts all unprotected government departments are likely to have to be cut to meet the targets for cutting the deficit, which were set out in the Budget. The Conservatives are yet to set out plans for the next three years of funding for the Home Office. Labour says it has identified \u00c2\u0092\u00c3\u009b\u00c2\u008a\u00c2\u0097_\u00c2\u0092\u00c3\u00a4\u00c3\u008e\u00c2\u00a3800m of savings that could be made in police forces, which would prevent the loss of 10,000 jobs that it says the Conservatives would have to cut in the next three years. Labour's figures assume that all departments will be cut by the same amount. Of course, when the next government has its spending review, it could decide to make much more severe cuts to some departments than others. Labour says it will save \u00c2\u0092\u00c3\u009b\u00c2\u008a\u00c2\u0097_\u00c2\u0092\u00c3\u00a4\u00c3\u008e\u00c2\u00a3800m by doing things such as scrapping the elections for police and crime commissioners, which are due to take place next year, and making people pay the full cost when they apply for a gun licence. The Conservatives respond that scrapping commissioners and other measures would not save as much as Labour claims and that they have already announced plans to increase the fees for gun licences. The biggest proposed savings come from making it compulsory for police forces to buy things together to increase their negotiating power. The Conservatives say that already happens in a lot of cases but that Labour has overestimated the potential savings. The Tories also point out that, despite the falls in police numbers over the past five years, crime has fallen. The two things may be unrelated and crime has been falling since the late 1990s. So it is difficult to demonstrate either that if the Conservatives were to win the election they would cut 10,000 police staff over the next three years or indeed that Labour's plans would prevent that happening. What this argument does highlight is how tight a timetable the next government will be working to. Departments only have spending plans laid out for a year from now.

Correspondents say it is one of Mexico's worst incidents of alleged child abuse at a children's institution in many years. The government said the building was home to 278 boys, 174 girls and six infants under the age of three. Also rescued were 138 adults aged up to 40, the government said. Reports say the residents were forced to live in terrible conditions. \"I'm in utter dismay because we weren't expecting the conditions we found at the group home,\" Michoacan Governor Salvador Jara said. The House of the Big Family has been operating for 40 years and was known locally as Mama Rosa's Home. The authorities began to investigate the home after parents complained that they were denied access to their children. One woman, who grew up at the home herself, gave birth to two children who were registered in the name of Ms Verduzco. When the mother left the home, aged 31, she was not allowed to take her children with her, investigators said. Mr Jara said the raid came after an official complaint was filed by the parents of five children who said they were being held at the home against their will. He said the complaint was filed more than a year ago, but did not specify why the authorities had not acted sooner. Local media had reported on allegations made against the home as far back as 2010. By Will Grant, BBC Mundo, Mexico City Mexicans are waking up to the news with a sense of shock and disbelief - mainly at the sheer scale of the alleged abuse at Casa Mama Rosa. The list of accusations is long and serious: almost 500 children held against their will and sent into the streets to beg, their parents prevented fromt them, sexual and psychological abuse at what is a well-known and often praised children's home. As such, this certainly stands out from other stories of abuse in Mexican institutions and has sparked some uncomfortable questions.

He said she agreed to let Mrs Clinton off the hook in return for the promise that she would keep her job if the Democrat won the election and became president. The news that the attorney general met former President Bill Clinton, Mrs Clinton's husband, last week on the tarmac of an airport in Arizona prompted accusations by Republicans of a stitch-up.

But it does give schools \"discretionary power to authorise up to 10 days absence during a school year for family holidays during term time\". Two campaign groups have drawn up petitions calling for children to be allowed term-time holidays.

Family violence activists say Ms Batty's ability to explain to the public why so many women struggle to protect their children from violent partners helped make the issue of family violence a key campaign issue for all political parties in last November's Victoria state election. Greg Anderson, 54, killed Luke Batty in front of shocked onlookers at a cricket oval in Tyabb. The father and son had been playing together during an access visit in February 2014 when Anderson suddenly struck his son with a cricket bat and stabbed him. Anderson was shot by police after threatening them with a knife when they tried to detain him. He died later in hospital. Ms Batty was at the cricket ground when the attack happened.

The museum invited people to nominate games played on PCs, consoles, hand-held gadgets, phones or in arcades. The winners span three decades of gaming from Pong, first released in 1972, to World of Warcraft which debuted in late 2004. Pong was chosen because it launched the entire games industry, said the museum in a statement, revealing the six entrants in its Hall of Fame. It acknowledged that it was not the first electronic game but was the first to get \"wide-scale public attention\". Other games were chosen for becoming cultural icons (Tetris), making games a mass-market phenomenon (Pac-Man) and changing the way games were made (Doom). World of Warcraft was chosen, said the museum, because of its longevity and the way it has brought millions of players together into one game world. The winners were whittled down from a long list of 15 that was picked by an internal panel of academics, journalists and game experts recruited by The Strong. Their decisions were based on a game's longevity, influence, geographical reach and iconic status. The museum now plans to feature the winning games, the other nominees and many others in a permanent exhibition. The other nine nominees included Legend of Zelda, Space Invaders, the Oregon Trail and Pokemon. Nominees for the 2016 inductees to the hall of fame are now being accepted.

The two-year orders aim to disrupt gang-related violence between the Burger Bar Boys and Johnson Crew. West Midlands Police said it was \"a landmark ruling\". The orders follow a spate of firearms offences in the city in 2015 and 2016, but the gangs have struck fear across parts of Birmingham for many years. They gained notoriety in 2003 when their violent feud claimed the lives of two girls - Letisha Shakespeare and Charlene Ellis - outside a late-night new year party in the city. Four men were later jailed for life for their murders. The gangs have also been behind countless drive-by shootings, drug dealing, intimidation, robberies and kidnappings. After more recent incidents of gun crime in the city, West Midlands Police and the council sought to secure the injunctions in a civil case heard at Birmingham Crown Court earlier this year. The force secured interim injunctions in 2016 and said at the time it did not want to identify anyone until they were permanent.  The BBC revealed their names after obtaining the county court documents. More than 80 people from the Home Office and police gave evidence between February and June ahead of the orders being granted in July, which the force has revealed for the first time now. Two have already been issued, three men are being sought by police and three properties were visited by officers on Wednesday. The men are forbidden from associating with each other and entering the city centre, Handsworth, Newtown, Winson Green and Lozells. In a copy of an injunction seen by the BBC, gang members are also banned from appearing in music videos that include material linked to the Burger Bar Boys and Johnson Crew. One such music video was shown during the court proceedings. Ten other men will receive the orders in jail where restrictions will be imposed on certain visitors to limit any gang associations, police said. Among those to be given the injunctions in prison are two men believed to have been the \"armed response\" faction of the Burger Bar Boys.

But the wilderness of the non-league scene is exactly where the lifelong association between Flynn and Newport begun. Given a reprieve by manager Tim Harris and a chance with the first team after his youth team axing, Flynn also found employment as a postman. Thanks to his form with the Exiles, a nickname earned rather than chosen after years spent out of the city as a reformed club without a home, Flynn impressed as a midfielder with an eye for goal. In the non-league pyramid at least, this postman did always deliver. A switch to full time football was the dream, achieved with a transfer to Barry Town, a move that changed the course of Flynn's life. There was to be no future in shelf stacking or letter delivering for Flynn after joining the full time Welsh Premier League side, as he went on to make over 400 Football League appearances for the likes of Gillingham, Wigan and Bradford City. He returned to his first club and first love Newport County five years ago, helping to steer them to a promotion 25 years in the making. Flynn was 'heartbroken' when the club released him as Terry Butcher axed 11 players, after Newport's millionaire chairman Les Scadding opted to walk away from the club. He soon returned when the Supporters' Trust succeeded Scadding, working in various roles including as a club ambassador, in marketing, and as a first team coach. He even found time to get in a few games for Welsh League third-tier side Undy, so it was no surprise this season when Flynn came out of retirement to help the beleaguered Exiles. Flynn's career at County, and in football, was almost over before it started. \"I got kicked out of the youth team. The youth team manager Glyn Jones asked me what I had done at the weekend and I said I had played for Pill. He said 'I know, I saw in the local paper you scored a hat-trick.'

This time he was in the unfamiliar green kit of Real Madrid for a last-16 tie against United with the score delicately poised at 1-1 after the first leg in Spain. This was to become a bittersweet homecoming for the 28-year-old Portuguese. Ronaldo stayed on the field warming up with his pristine red boots for 16 minutes. His task: to keep his emotions under control and focus on the job of firing nine-time winners Madrid into the Champions League quarter finals. It was all about concentration. Ronaldo never once looked up at the vast Sir Alex Ferguson stand over his left shoulder as he practised shooting from 20 yards just to the left of centre - and finding the net every time. Warm-ups done and it was time for team embraces. High-fives all round. Madrid's players were as one and after a few stretching routines to finish, it was time to head back for the Special One's final instructions - the final team talk from Real Madrid manager Jose Mourinho. Ronaldo emerged again at 19:41 GMT. This time the atmosphere was hot, red hot.  And at 19:44 there was a special moment as the PA announcer ran through the team line-ups. \"And it's a special welcome back to number seven Cristiano Ronaldo,\" he boomed. Ronaldo waved, thumped his chest, waved again. His head bowed for a respectful moment before putting his hand back on to his chest. Just for a moment, those emotions must have threatened to run away from him. And the Manchester United support welcomed him back with a standing ovation which lasted until after referee Cuneyt Cakir started the match. United had the better of the first half and largely managed to shackle Ronaldo. When Sergio Ramos steered the ball into his own net to give the home side a 1-0 lead on the night, Old Trafford erupted and Ronaldo's head went down. He looked momentarily forlorn.

England are next in action on Tuesday when they face Sweden, the Olympic silver medallists from Rio, in Murcia. Their best chances against Norway fell to Fara Williams and Lucy Bronze, who saw efforts from the edge of the box go over the crossbar. Steph Houghton's shot from a corner was cleared off the line, while Ellen White had a penalty appeal turned down after she appeared to receive a shove in the penalty area. Norway continued to push for a second goal but Chamberlain made a string of impressive saves to deny the opposition. With the Women's Super League clubs returning from their close season break only two weeks ago, the majority of the England players are still some way from peak fitness. Even so, with the European Championship seven months away, a defeat by quality opposition such as Norway will be a disappointment to England manager Mark Sampson.

Having failed to create a single clear-cut chance in the first half, the introduction of Millie Bright and White looked welcome in the 68th minute. The team came to life in the closing moments, when they won a string of corners which they followed up with on-target efforts but failed to find the equaliser.

The move is aimed at creating a \"level playing field\" between homeowners and investors, chancellor George Osborne said. The change will be introduced over four years from April 2017. Currently property investors can claim tax relief on their monthly interest repayments at the top level of tax they pay, meaning the wealthiest can claim as much as 45%. Mr Osborne said the current system gave buy-to-let landlords \"a huge advantage in the market\", compared with home buyers. \"The better-off the landlord, the more tax relief they get,\" he said. Buy-to-let properties now account for over 15% of new mortgages, something the Bank of England warned last week could pose a risk to the UK's financial stability.

Last year Angelina Jolie had her ovaries and fallopian tubes removed after she was found to be at an increased risk of ovarian cancer due to a \"faulty\" BRCA 1 gene. Ms Taylor warned that women in Scotland would only qualify for olaparib if their BRCA status is known. She said: \"NHS Scotland must continue to make sure that all patients are offered a BRCA test at diagnosis so they can be treated with the best drugs available.\" Gregor McNie, of Cancer Research UK in Scotland, said the charity was also funding clinical trials to asses the potential for olaparib in the treatment of brain tumours and pancreatic cancer.

Panel member Sir Roderic Lyne, a former Ambassador to Russia, asked him whether the phrase \"didn't originally come from Chairman Mao\".

In 2009, he narrowly beat incumbent Malcolm Turnbull in a party leadership vote, winning 42 votes to Mr Turnbull's 41. Many pundits were shocked by the result, given Mr Abbott's gaffe-prone history. As leader of the opposition, Mr Abbott's aggressive approach earned him several nicknames. His tactics led some to call him \"Tear-down Tony\" or \"Mad Monk\" - a reference to his time spent training as a priest. He has also consistently voted against relaxing laws on abortion, same-sex marriages and stem cell research. His stance on social issues, and his poor polling among women, has led some to say that Mr Abbott has a \"women problem\". In October 2012, Ms Gillard's blistering speech in parliament accusing him of misogyny went viral online. He took on Labor's Kevin Rudd - who ousted Ms Gillard as Labor leader - in the September 2013 polls and secured a convincing win.

But he began to study in his spare time, eventually becoming a world-renowned expert on the botany and geology of Caithness. His achievements are being marked by the Tullibody History Group. The group said the event would look at the legacy of a \"remarkable, entirely self-taught man\". Despite a relatively humble upbringing - the son of an excise officer - his achievements were noted by some of the most prominent scientists of the day. Sir Roderick Murchison of the British Association of Scientists was said to have remarked about him: \"I found to my humiliation that this baker knew more of botanical  science - aye - 10 times more than I did.\" And the well-known naturalist Hugh Miller, who received many fossils from Dick, wrote that \"he has robbed himself to do me service\". In 1863, Dick had to sell part of his geological collection, which is now in the National Museums Scotland. He continued his research, but in August 1866 he collapsed while gathering specimens in a quarry. He never recovered fully and died four months later. The only memorial to him is in Thurso Cemetery, the Tullibody History Group said. Members of the group hope to erect a new memorial to the man to mark the bicentenary of his birth this year, as well as publishing a book about his life.

{"article": "The Dartmouth College team discovered the insects' communication system and studied females' reactions to the males' songs. They say the call is likely to have evolved from males impersonating hunting bats and startling females. Females' shuddering response appears to allow males to locate a mate. Close examination of females' nervous systems suggested that this shudder evolved from a startle reflex, the researchers say. The findings are published in the journal Current Biology. Lead researcher Prof Hannah ter Hofstede investigated this unusual insect duet after a colleague presented some recordings of the insects' particularly high frequency chirps. \"It struck me as very strange that these crickets would use such high frequencies for mating purposes,\" the scientists said. Other cricket species avoid sounds at these frequencies, which are similar to the sounds that bats make when navigating and hunting. Prof ter Hofstede used playback experiments - playing males' songs through speakers - to test females' reaction to the high, bat-like chirps. \"I expected the females to walk to the speaker, because this is the usual behaviour for female crickets, but they did not do this - [they instead] made a small jerking motion after each male call,\" she explained. \"From many observations of males and females together, I noticed that it was always the male walking to the female when she produced these vibrational signals.\" Further study revealed that the male calls also triggered activity in a nerve cell known to be responsible for triggering escape behaviour in crickets. This, along with careful tracking of the cricket evolutionary tree, led Prof ter Hofstede and her colleagues to conclude that what is now a mating song and dance routine originated from a reflex startled \"jump\". This, the scientists say, is an example of \"how communication systems can change over evolutionary time. \"And that even something as unlikely as a reflex response to a predator can be the origin for a new communication signal.\"\n", "summary": "Crickets have been spotted in the cricket nest.<br/>", "label": "factual", "errors": []}

In front of MPs, Google's president for Europe, Matt Brittin defended the company's UK tax arrangements.  Its public stance has been that:  \"Governments make tax law, the tax authorities independently enforce the law, and Google complies with the law.\" In which case, the authorities in the UK and beyond seem to be concluding that what's required is a change in the law. Chancellor George Osborne has already instigated a clampdown on the way multinationals shift their profits to different jurisdictions to pay less tax, known as the \"diverted profits tax\". HMRC has said that the new tax, which came into effect in April last year, is aimed at capturing tax from organisations that don't pay corporation tax on their profits in the UK. Google, says HMRC, has paid the taxes that it is supposed to pay. Which, say critics, suggests this new tax doesn't go far enough. Last month, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) successfully brokered an agreement designed to improve the current system. All 31 of its member countries, which include the US, Bermuda and Guernsey, have agreed to share information on the tax international firms pay, leaving them less room for moving their profits into low tax jurisdictions. But the plan would still require implementation at national level. At the heart of the agreement is the concept of transparency, in particular what is known as \"country-by-country reporting\". This would force companies to tell the tax office of each country in which they operate, how many staff they employ there, what their revenues and profit are and how much tax they pay. The European Commission has proposed EU member states do the same.  If its plan is approved, which experts say is unlikely as any direct tax measures require unanimity, it could eventually be turned into law by individual countries. The Commission has said it is also looking separately at whether these accounts should be opened up to public scrutiny and will publish its findings in the spring. If such scrutiny were ever implemented, it could be a powerful incentive for firms to change, says Richard Murphy, professor of international political economy at London's City University. \"If multinationals feel\n", "summary": "The head of Google's European business, Matt Brittin, is facing a public inquiry into his finances.<br/>", "label": "factually incorrect", "errors": ["Pronoun entity error"]}
{"article": "Muhammadu Buhari said that if a credible Boko Haram leadership could be identified then he was prepared to talk with them without preconditions. But he said he had no intelligence on the girls' whereabouts or their health. Boko Haram seized the girls from their dormitories in the north-eastern town of Chibok in April 2014. \"If a credible leader of Boko Haram can be established and they tell us where those girls are, we are prepared to negotiate with them, without any precondition,\" said Mr Buhari. Attempts to negotiate with Boko Haram during the rule of ex-President Goodluck Jonathan failed because officials were talking to the wrong people in the fragmented militant group. BBC Nigeria analyst Naziru Mikailu says Mr Buhari's offer to revive talks shows that Boko Haram remains a force, despite his claim last week that the group had been \"technically\" defeated. There is little prospect of Boko Haram agreeing to negotiate the release of the girls, he adds. The militants regard the girls as their most invaluable captives and their leader, Abubakar Shekau, said last year that most of them had converted to Islam and had been married off. Some Nigerians on social media expressed anger at the president for saying the government had no idea where the girls were being held, saying it indicated a failure of the intelligence services. Mr Buhari took office in May with a promise to defeat the group, and gave the military a deadline of the end of the year to end the six-year insurgency. Although Boko Haram has been driven out from most of the areas it controlled in north-eastern Nigeria, it has continued to carry out suicide bombings and raids into neighbouring Cameroon, Chad and Niger. The military has managed to free hundreds of Boko Haram captives in recent months. However, they did not include any of the Chibok girls.

Germany international Schweinsteiger, 30, and 29-year-old Spain player Ramos are among those who interest him. Ramos' contract with Real expires in 2017, while Schweinsteiger's Bayern deal runs until 2016. Scorer of Real's injury-time equaliser in their Champions League final victory over Atletico Madrid in 2014, Ramos has made 445 appearances for the club since joining from Sevilla in 2005. He has 128 Spain caps and was in the starting line-up as they won Euro 2008, Euro 2012 and the 2010 World Cup. Schweinsteiger also has a World Cup winners' medal - starting for Germany in their victory over Argentina last year. He has been with Bayern all his career and won his eighth league title in May. He also won the Champions League in 2013. Real's interest in goalkeeper David De Gea will be used by United in their attempt to sign Ramos. Van Gaal said at the end of last season it would not be easy to keep De Gea - United's player of the year for the second successive year. The 24-year-old Spain international has refused to extend his contract beyond 2016. The Red Devils have been linked with several potential replacements during what Van Gaal said could be a \"rough\" summer for some of his players given the changes he anticipated. \"A club like Manchester United has to be like that,\" said Van Gaal in May. \"When you purchase other players you get a stimulus.\" Van Gaal is particularly keen to recruit a right-back, central defender, central midfielder and striker.

On his blog, comedian and campaigner Brand called the UKIP leader an \"an end of the pier, end of the road, end of days politician\". Mr Farage wrote on the Independent website that Brand had been exposed as a \"messiah with feet of clay\". The two men were joined on Thursday night's show by Conservative Communities Minister Penny Mordaunt, shadow international development secretary Mary Creagh, and Times columnist Camilla Cavendish. In an often heated debate, with members of the audience yelling at each other and the panel, Brand called Mr Farage a \"pound shop Enoch Powell\" during a section on immigration, with the UKIP leader responding by saying he believed the UK was \"overcrowded\". The barbs did not stop when filming ended, as Mr Farage said the performance of the \"sometime comedian turned banker-basher\" had been \"limp\". He wrote: \"Mr Brand will swan around and tout long-discredited, even conspiratorial, theories about the City of London, and 'who owns politicians' - but actually he had very little to give.\" For his part, Brand said Mr Farage was \"worse than stagnant, he is a tribute act, he is a nostalgic spasm for a Britain that never was; an infinite cricket green with no-one from the colonies to raise the game, grammar schools on every corner and shamed women breastfeeding under giant parasols\". The breastfeeding reference followed a row over Mr Farage's suggestion that some venues might ask mothers to \"perhaps sit in a corner\" to feed their babies. Both men praised the audience of Question Time, which was filmed in Canterbury. Brand, who was urged to stand for Parliament by one man in the crowd. added: \"The only worthwhile sentiments, be they raging or insightful, come from the audience\". Other questions focused on the NHS, grammar schools and trust in politicians. The programme was watched by an average of 3.5 million viewers, with the audience peaking at 4.6 million at the start. This was nearly a million higher than the previous week's episode, but well below the 7.9 million viewers who watched ex-BNP leader Nick Griffin's appearance on the show in 2009.

She told Victoria Derbyshire she hopes it will counter misconceptions. The video - which sees the 28-year-old tell her story through cardboard signs - has been viewed over 19,000 times. Ms Young contracted HIV following a non-sexual attack in 2013 - for which she decided not to press charges - and prior to the video had only informed a handful of people close to her of the infection. Among them, she explained, were some negative reactions, with one person referring to her as \"dangerous\". Her loss of hair was also causing rumours to spread in her church, with many people concerned over her health. It was a result of these factors, she explained, that she \"thought it was time that I informed my congregation\". \"I knew telling them face to face was going to be quite difficult for myself and them so I thought about how I could do it creatively,\" she added. Her decision to choose a \"cardboard testimony\" was a result of having seen the popularity of such videos in the United States. The video explains the symptoms Ms Young - who has been a minister at the church since January 2011 - has experienced since contracting HIV, but also looks to counter any misconceptions surrounding the infection. \"I think people were worried about me being around children, how they can contract it,\" she told Victoria Derbyshire. One individual thought HIV could be passed on through kissing. \"People just don't know unfortunately,\" she added. Since the video was posted on May 10, Ms Young says she has been overwhelmed by the reaction from church-goers. \"On the whole, the congregation have been amazing and [they're from] a variety of ages and a variety of backgrounds, so I've been humbled by their positivity.\" She says she is glad many others have been \"inspired and encouraged\" by the video, but does not feel it is her role to become a spokesperson for those with HIV. Ms Young also explained how she had been hurt by some of the abusive messages YouTube users had posted on the video, although she is now learning to come to terms with them. \"When you put your head above the parapet, it's going to happen, isn't it?\" she said.

Leeds Coroners' Court heard Harry was struck at an area of the farm not usually open to the public. Tractor driver Gary Green was arrested but never charged. Mr Green had 90 micrograms of alcohol in 100ml of breath at the time of the accident. The legal limit is 35 micrograms. The court heard Mr Green was arrested on suspicion of drink-driving and causing death by dangerous driving but was later released and never charged. West Yorkshire Police said a criminal prosecution could not be brought because the incident occurred on private land. Jurors were told Harry had gone into the area where he was run over just after 09:00 BST. His mother, Pamela Whitlam, who worked at the farm's cafe, said she had not explained to him where he could or could not go because she was not familiar with the layout of the site. In a statement to the court, she described how just before the accident she told her son: \"Be careful.\" Moments later she ran outside to find him lying on the floor after being hit by the vehicle. Jurors heard Mr Green had drunk \"three of four pints\" at the pub the night before the accident and continued drinking at home until 01:45. Following his arrest, he told police officers: \"I don't know where he came from because no-one should be down the back of the tractor.\" The inquest continues.

A lot of them come from overseas, in fact, 90% of researchers at British universities come from overseas, and we must encourage them to stay here.\" \"I would change our immigration laws to allow the right sort of people to stay here,\" he said. In addition, Mr Dyson said he didn't particularly want to stay in the EU. \"I think it's a European Union dominated by Germany, and in our particular field we have these very large German companies who dominate standards setting and energy reduction committees, and so we get the old guard and old technology supported and not new technology. \"I want to keep EFTA - European free trade - and free movement of peoples, but I don't see that we need to be dominated and bullied by the Germans.\" Dyson's \u00c2\u0092\u00c3\u00a4\u00c3\u008e\u00c2\u00a31bn investment plan represents a significant increase in R&D spending at the company, which first made a name for itself selling bagless vacuum cleaners.

It showed most trusts did not increase their charges, but the average rise among the third that did was 15%. The analysis combines figures obtained from NHS trusts and data submitted to statistics body NHS Digital. The most expensive trust in the country for a one-hour stay is the Royal Surrey County Hospital in Guildford, where patients are forced to pay \u00c2\u0092\u00c3\u00a4\u00c3\u008e\u00c2\u00a34 for any stay up to two hours. Deputy chief executive Alf Turner said the charge was necessary to cover running costs and fund the expansion of the car park that is taking place. \"I do not like having to charge people for car parking and in an ideal world we would not have to,\" he added. At the other end of the scale, car parking at Trafford General Hospital in Greater Manchester is free for up to three hours. Some trusts allow patients and visitors to park for free for the first 30 minutes before charges start. But others have scrapped cheaper charges for short stays, meaning people have to pay a flat fee covering up to three hours even if they are only staying for 45 minutes. Of the 209 hospital trusts that reported figures to NHS Digital for both 2014/15 and 2015/16, a third showed an increase in their average charge for a three-hour stay. Some 60% showed no change over the year, while 7% showed a decrease. Some 38% also said they also charged for disabled parking. England is the only part of the UK where hospitals routinely charge patients and visitors for parking. Laura Keely, campaigns manager at Macmillan Cancer Support, said charges are particularly unfair on cancer patients. \"They often need to make frequent trips to hospital. They should not be left out of pocket in order to receive life-saving treatment.\" Some NHS trusts offer concessions to visitors whose loved one is terminally ill and also discounts or weekly tickets for lengthy courses of treatment.

Ms Hollands, a mother of three, went to Darent Valley Hospital complaining of breathing difficulties and chest and stomach pain. She had suffered an ectopic pregnancy three weeks earlier. Gravesend Coroner's Court heard the former drug user was taking methadone to treat her addiction, but had stopped for a few days. Ms Hollands was given an electrocardiogram (ECG) and methadone, and was given her discharge papers.

Lawyers for the estate this week confirmed a number of unnamed relatives have been barred from visiting the Jackson family home. Writing in his statement about the confrontation at the Jackson family home on 23 July, Jermaine said \"it was clear that mutual suspicions had allowed events to spiral out of control\". \"I regret that events were ever allowed to reach such a stage,\" he wrote. \"I regret any distress caused to Prince, Paris and Blanket.

'Overwhelmed' Janet, Randy, Jermaine and Rebbie are all understood to have signed a letter, which was leaked to the press, alleging the will was a fake and calling on executors of the estate to resign.

The annual Parliamentary party departmental committee elections normally pass without controversy. But this year there appears to have been a concerted effort by Corbyn-sceptic MPs to gain control of one of the party's policy making mechanisms, according to grassroots website Labour List. Particularly as only four of the 17 posts were contested - although that may be because most of Corbyn's Labour allies already have roles as shadow ministers.

The conflict and a blockade imposed by the coalition have also triggered a humanitarian disaster, leaving 80% of the population in need of aid. The conflict has its roots in the failure of the political transition that was supposed to bring stability to Yemen following an uprising that forced its longtime authoritarian president, Ali Abdullah Saleh, to hand over power to Mr Hadi, his deputy, in November 2011. Mr Hadi struggled to deal with a variety of problems, including attacks by al-Qaeda, a separatist movement in the south, the continuing loyalty of many military officers to Mr Saleh, as well as corruption, unemployment and food insecurity. The Houthi movement, which champions Yemen's Zaidi Shia Muslim minority and fought a series of rebellions against Mr Saleh during the previous decade, took advantage of the new president's weakness by taking control of their northern heartland of Saada province and neighbouring areas. Disillusioned with the transition, many ordinary Yemenis - including Sunnis - supported the Houthis and in September 2014 they entered the capital, Sanaa, setting up street camps and roadblocks. In January 2015, the Houthis reinforced their takeover of Sanaa, surrounding the presidential palace and other key points and effectively placing Mr Hadi and his cabinet ministers under house arrest. The president escaped to the southern port city of Aden the following month. The Houthis and security forces loyal to Mr Saleh then attempted to take control of the entire country, forcing Mr Hadi to flee abroad in March 2015.

{"article": "The 10,000-year-old remains of 27 people found west of Lake Turkana show that they met violent deaths. They were left to die there rather than being buried. Many experts have argued that conflict only came about as humans became more settled. These people, by contrast, were apparently nomadic hunter-gatherers. The archaeologists, who have been working on the site at Nataruk since 2012, discovered that the victims were clubbed or stabbed to death in a single event. The dead included male and female adults, as well as children. The evidence, published in the journal Nature, does not reveal exactly what happened but the fact that so many people died at the same time suggests it was the result of \"some sort of conflict\", according to Cambridge University Professor Robert Foley. Nataruk records what is, for now, the oldest scientifically-dated case of conflict between two nomadic hunter-gatherer groups. Nevertheless, its significance is not its age, but the fact that it involved these groups, who had few possessions to fight over. Nataruk establishes definitively that inter-group violence can and did arise regardless of whether the populations were settled. All it needed was moments of food abundance, causing groups to grow in size, putting pressure on the resources. Then the benefits of stealing from another group could outweigh the costs of the conflict that might ensue. Nataruk was an important place because it was at the edge of a super lake beach which would have attracted all land animals to drink, as well as giving access to fishing grounds, while other parts of the shore of Lake Turkana (the forested Kerio Delta, for example, or the rocky whole southern edge) would not have that. It is believed that the group was attacked by rival hunter-gatherers armed with wooden clubs and arrows or spears tipped with sharpened obsidian, a rare black volcanic rock. Speculating on the causes of the attack, Marta Mirazon Lahr, who led the Nataruk study, said the \"massacre may have resulted from an attempt to seize resources... whose value was similar to those of later food-producing agricultural societies, among whom violent attacks on settlements became part of life\".

Judge David Harris said he was not convinced that Ms Krajnc obstructed the use of property when she gave water to pigs headed to slaughter. Ms Krajnc said it confirms \"compassion is not a crime\". Mischief to property is a criminal offence in Canada related to the wilful destruction or damage of property. Justice Harris wrote in his decision that he is satisfied that Ms Krajnc \"did not obstruct, interrupt or interfere with the lawful use, enjoyment or operation of any property\" when in July 2015, she gave water to a few animals being carried in a tractor trailer filled with 190 pigs going to a slaughterhouse outside Toronto. Ms Krajnc, who co-founded an organisation called Toronto Pig Save in 2011, regularly gathered with other activists on a traffic island at an intersection near a large slaughterhouse to pet the animals and give them water. But this time, the truck driver confronted Ms Krajnc and police were called. A video of the tense encounter was posted online by the activists. During her trial, supporters crammed into the courtroom, many sitting on the floor. Members of the media sat in the prisoner's box. Despite her win on Thursday, Ms Krajnc told the BBC she has \"mixed feelings\" about the decision. \"We were hoping for recognition in the legal system that pigs and other animals are simply not property - that they are sentient beings, that they have basic rights,\" she said. In his decision, Justice Harris noted that under Canadian law, pigs are property. \"Ms Krajnc and like-minded individuals may believe otherwise and they are fully entitled to that belief. That does not however make it so,\" he wrote. Ms Krajnc's case and her efforts to \"hold vigil\" for animals headed to slaughter have caught on with animal rights activists around the world.

But judge Bill Dunlop QC told Shaw that the evidence against him was \"overwhelming\". He said: \"You carried out an appalling catalogue of perverted, predatory behaviour towards two children. \"You stole their childhood and affected the quality of their adult lives. \"I can never understand why, while you are violating children, you don't think these people will become adults and one day will bring you to account.\" Judge Dunlop said that, but for Shaw's age, he would have imposed a longer sentence. Shaw was placed on the sex offenders' register for life. His seven-year sentence will begin after he finishes a 21-month sentence for stalking a 15-year-old girl. Solicitor advocate John Keenan, defending, told the court that Shaw had a heart condition and did not expect to be released from custody. Shaw's victims, who are now in their 40s, went to the police after hearing on the radio that he had been convicted of stalking the schoolgirl. Advocate depute Paul Brown, prosecuting, said: \"The accused has previous convictions for sexual offences against children.\" Shaw was found guilty of eight charges of sexual abuse, including rape. Many of the offences took place in a caravan. Shaw would ply his young victims with alcohol and make them watch pornographic videos before abusing them. He raped his 11-year-old victim again on various occasions when she was aged between 16 and 19. Shaw claimed that he had had consensual sex with the girl once she turned 16, but the jury did not believe him. In evidence, his victims said he ruined their childhoods. One of them said: \"He said if we ever told what had happened to us we would be taken away from our families.\" The jail term was welcomed by NSPCC Scotland which praised Shaw's victims for coming forward to report his \"heinous\" crimes.

It said there was complacency about the impact of rapid population growth which it said \"could change the UK forever\". Remain said leaving the EU and damaging the economy was not the answer. Immigration has been a key battleground in the referendum campaign ahead of the vote on EU membership on 23 June. Net migration to the UK rose to 333,000 in 2015, according to Office for National Statistics estimates released in May - the second highest figure on record - figures which the Leave campaign argue illustrates the inability of the UK to control migration while being in the EU. Migration Watch, which campaigns for reduced migration, has now looked over a 20-year period at the impact on net migration in the event the UK votes to remain in the EU on 23 June. This issue covers immigration and free movement within Europe. Net migration is the difference between the number of people coming to the UK for at least a year and those leaving. It said the figure of 265,000 excluded the possibility of Turkey joining the EU altogether and took the average of the high and low migration scenarios. Under its low migration scenario, net migration from the EU would fall to 135,000 by the end of the period and only a small number of refugees who have already arrived in other parts of the EU would relocate to Britain. In this scenario the government would successfully reduce non-EU net migration to 100,000 a year and British emigration would remain at 50,000 a year, leading to total net migration of 205,000. For the high scenario, net migration from the EU would rise to 220,000 by 2031. In this scenario, non-EU migration would remain at 150,000 per year and British emigration would remain at 50,000 net per year, leading to net migration to the UK to 320,000 in 20 years' time, it said. Lord Green of Deddington, chairman of Migration Watch UK said: \"This report is a final wake-up call. Even leaving aside the prospect of Turkey joining the EU, it shows that net migration could still be running at 265,000 a year in 20 years' time. \"This would bring our population to 80 million within 30 years.

Officials said the blasts were caused by improvised bombs. HDP co-chair Selahattin Demirtas criticised Mr Erdogan's response to the killings. Casting his vote on Sunday Mr Demirtas commented: \"The election campaigning process was not a fair and equal race.\" However he added: \"Hopefully we will wake up to a new and freer Turkey on 8 June.\" Polls across Turkey's 81 provinces opened at 08:00 (05:00 GMT) local time and closed at 17:00 (14:00 GMT). First results are expected late on Sunday. If the left-wing HDP succeeds in winning seats in parliament for the first time, it would reduce the number of seats won by Mr Erdogan's AKP, thwarting its plans to change the constitution and transfer the prime minister's executive powers to the president.

In 2010, 44% of 18 to 24-year-olds voted, with the \"younger and poorer\" least likely to vote, it suggested. The UK risks \"sleepwalking into a more divided democracy\" unless there is reform, the IPPR's Mat Lawrence said. \"The working class and the young have less input into political decision-making processes, with lower rates of participation and representation than older and more affluent citizens,\" the IPPR report suggested. Such inequalities undermined the \"legitimacy and effectiveness\" of democracy, the report claimed, saying it was unlikely the trend would be reversed in next month's general election. At the 1970 general election, the gap between the proportion of 18-24 year olds and over-65s who voted was 18%. However, at the 2010 general election, the gap had risen to 32% - with 76% of over-65s voting, compared to 44% of 18-24 year olds. \"Long-run decline in voter turnout in the UK is being driven by the relative collapse in participation among the young and the less well-off - not by a uniform decline in turnout among all groups,\" Mr Lawrence added. \"A distinctive non-voting population, generally younger and poorer, heightens political inequality by giving some groups far greater influence at the ballot box.\" The report comes after the voting age was reduced to 16 for the Scottish independence referendum, in September - when 109,593 16 and 17-year-olds registered to vote.

{"article": "In recent weeks, there has been an upsurge in campaigning comments on popular microblog Sina Weibo, where users are encouraging victims of sexual assault, domestic violence and rape to make their voices heard. Rape can be taboo in China and victims are often afraid to come forward. Domestic violence can also be stigmatised, and China only passed its first domestic violence law in December 2015. Moreover, women's rights activists in China have sometimes struggled to speak out. In 2015, five prominent activists were arrested, prompting international online campaigns using the #FreeTheFive hashtag. One of the biggest stories dominating social media in recent days has been the alleged rape of a female intern at a Chinese media company. Police in southern Guangzhou say they have arrested a reporter working for the Southern Daily newspaper. Two other interns have said they were sexually harassed by the individual. The #OnlineFeverThatJournalistRapedFemaleIntern hashtag has been trending for the past two days and social media users have been particularly interested in an exclusive interview conducted with the alleged victim by the Women Awakening rights group. Using the pseudonym Little Flower, she said she initially \"didn't realise it was rape\" and had thought of rape as \"a stranger in the street... using violence, a knife to force you\". She added that she didn't think much would come of the case, as she described her alleged attacker as \"well-known\". Weibo users have also been following an incident of alleged domestic violence in northern China. The hashtag #BeatenBecauseBoyfriendSuspectedCheating has been trending after images circulated of Beijing-based user \"YuzuSama\" with black eyes and bruises. After the images gained traction online, YuzuSama said she had been encouraged to go to hospital and to contact the police. Weibo users told her \"not to be afraid\" after she posted from the police station that her boyfriend had been arrested. She told users on 30 June: \"When I saw him, I was still terribly scared.\" Thousands of female users have also been making their voices heard against other, more routine, offences. In the past month, Weibo campaigns including #ShanghaiMetroWolf, #NowAWretchedManOnChengduMetro and #TwoWomenMolestedonMetroLine13 have been trending, after a number of women decided to \"out\" men who had touched them inappropriately on crowded subways.

{"article": "It comes after the special rapporteur on torture said some aspects violated the convention against torture. Australia detains all asylum seekers who arrive by boat, holding them in offshore processing camps. Rights groups have criticised conditions on Manus Island, where asylum-seekers are held. In a new report to be tabled to the UN Human Rights Council on Monday, the rapporteur, Juan Mendez, investigated allegations of torture and abuse in more than 60 countries. In Australia, he highlighted some cases where the authorities had failed to provide adequate detention conditions, end the detention of children, or prevent escalating violence and tension at Manus Island. This meant Australia had violated the right of the asylum-seeker to be free from torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, the report said. The Australian government has rejected the report. When asked about the UN's findings, Mr Abbott told reporters:  \"I really think Australians are sick of being lectured to by the United Nations, particularly, given that we have stopped the boats, and by stopping the boats, we have ended the deaths at sea.\" He said hundreds had drowned at sea as the people-smuggling trade flourished under the previous government. Mr Abbott said stopping the flow of people coming to Australia by boat, mostly through Indonesia, was the \"most humanitarian, most decent, the most compassionate thing you can do\". \"We have stopped the boats and I think the UN's representatives would have a lot more credibility if they were to give some credit to the Australian government for what we've been able to achieve in this area,\" Mr Abbott said. When asked about conditions on Manus, Mr Abbott said: \"All of the basic needs of the people on Manus Island are being met ... everyone's needs for food, for clothing, for shelter, for safety are being more than met.\" One of the allegations investigated by Mr Mendez is the intimidation and ill-treatment of two asylum-seekers after they gave statements about violent attacks at Manus. He found their rights were in fact breached. He also found that two government changes to immigration legislation risk violating international laws prohibiting torture. The report found violations in more than 60 other countries including in the US for the 30-year imprisonment of a mentally ill man on death row.

{"article": "The film, based on the fantasy game World of Warcraft (WoW), will open in China on 8 June, two days before it begins screening in the US, although it will be screened in various countries prior to that. The game sees players exploring a vast landscape, complete quests and interact with other gamers, and is known for its colourful array of monsters and landscapes, giving rise to its Chinese name \"World of Magic Beasts\". China is one of the biggest markets for WoW. The Chinese are estimated to make up about half of its five million players. One of the studios behind the movie, Legendary Entertainment, is majority owned by Chinese conglomerate Dalian Wanda, which acquired a controlling stake in January. But the decision is also part of an accelerating trend where Hollywood has been wooing China by staging elaborate premieres and tie-ups. The last Transformers movie was partly funded by Chinese backers and shot in China - though that ran into controversy - and the latest Star Wars movie was heavily promoted in China with publicity stunts and the appointment of pop star Luhan as an ambassador. The love story between China and WoW is one of perseverance, as the game's popularity has soared despite deep government suspicion prompting heavy controls, according to tech blog Engadget. Chinese players had to make do with a special version of the game with its violence, gore and even character design toned down. Skeletons were \"covered up\" with flesh, and even the colour of spilt blood was changed to a darker, less shocking hue. The government also insisted that a timer mechanism be built into the game to prevent people from playing it for too long, following widespread fears of internet addiction. Last year one WoW player reportedly collapsed and died after playing it for 19 hours without a break. Operation of the game in China was originally in foreign hands, but it eventually was bought over by Chinese company NetEase. But such obstacles could not stop its runaway success - part of the reason was the timing, as the game was first introduced China in 2005, at a time where online access and internet cafes were fast proliferating amid a booming tech scene. In a nod to its popularity, creator Blizzard Entertainment made a Chinese-inspired expansion to the game called Mists of Pandaria in 2012, featuring panda warriors and monk characters.

Clubs so often happy to leave United with a narrow defeat have boarded their respective team buses with landmark victories, domestic cup hopes have ended and, after midweek defeat at Olympiakos, the Red Devils' European dreams are on the same path. Moyes put his head in his hands as Robin van Persie ballooned a late chance over the bar in Greece. In truth, supporters could be forgiven for having done the same at a far earlier stage, such was the latest bland offering in a season in which one disappointment has quickly followed another. I still believe Moyes is the man to lead United in what would always be a tricky post-Sir Alex Ferguson era. What I did not expect was for so much to go wrong so quickly. Here are 10 Moyes mistakes at Manchester United: One moment which stood out to me was his admission he did not substitute Robin van Persie in the home defeat by Newcastle because of the potential reaction from supporters. So what? He would have made the change at Everton. He was once fearless, but suddenly fearful. Fearful of a backlash. Moyes should not care about what others think because he is at United because of his ability. He is good enough. He was the man chosen and now he has to believe in himself. I have spent time with him and he is a passionate, hard-working man, but that will count for little if he does not start believing in himself a bit more. This, I thought, would change. He was criticised at Everton for not beating the big clubs and, this season, in the head-to-head table of the league's top seven clubs, United sit bottom. They have just one win in nine games against those sides and five defeats. It just is not good enough for a United team. Moyes carries an inferiority in the big games and it is a big question mark.

Indeed, Mr Cameron's new cabinet, following his election victory in May, has just two minority-ethnic cabinet ministers. It is all a far cry from 1987, when four new black and minority-ethnic MPs - all Labour - entered the House, a symbolic and powerful moment for many observers. Paul Boateng had the most successful ministerial career, eventually making it into the cabinet as chief secretary to the Treasury. Much of the commentary focused on his being the first black cabinet minister and some speculated that he might rise to the very top. It was not to be. He now sits in the Lords. Keith Vaz rose to become the first Asian minister in the Commons in 1999. Mr Vaz's newsworthy quotes keep him in the public eye as the long-serving chairman of the home affairs select committee. Diane Abbott has a big political and media profile but has stayed on the back benches, as did Bernie Grant, before his premature death. The Tories at that time had no real equivalent representation in terms of black and minority-ethnic MPs. There was a lingering suspicion that the majority of voters from these communities didn't like the Conservatives. There was a damaging public row when a black candidate, John Taylor, was selected to fight Cheltenham in 1992. There was opposition from the local association and the campaign itself was marred by racist jibes. Taylor lost. It was the Blair-Brown years that changed the landscape at ministerial level. The Tottenham MP, David Lammy, was one early star. He rose quickly and, having been elected at just 27, he was immediately weighed down by the \"Britain's next black prime minister\" label. He didn't last but he has reinvented himself as a vocal backbencher and is in the mix to be Labour's choice for London mayor. Baroness Scotland, the first ethnic minority attorney general, was another prominent appointment. Then there was Shahid Malik, who became Britain's first Muslim minister in 2007. When David Cameron came to power in 2010, he brought in Baroness Sayeeda Warsi. She was the first Muslim woman cabinet minister.

She was joined at the party by three other royals, the Countess of Wessex, the Duchess of Gloucester and the Queen's cousin Princess Alexandra. Members of the Rylstone and District WI in North Yorkshire created the infamous calendar in 1999 to raise money after one of their husbands - John Baker - was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma and later died from the illness. Their story was immortalised in the hit movie Calendar Girls starring Helen Mirren and Julie Walters, and now Take That front man Gary Barlow is working on a musical based on their experiences. Mr Baker's widow Angela, 69, who has since remarried, was one of six of the original Calendar Girls invited to the palace. She was played by Julie Walters in the film, and was the piano-playing Miss February in the calendar.

{"article": "Strictly speaking, though, it is not a tax at all. The government says it is simply removing the \"spare room subsidy\" which put social sector tenants in a better position than those in the private rental sector. Ministers argue the changes will encourage people to downsize to smaller properties, and in doing so,  help cut the \u00c2\u0092\u00c3\u00a4\u00c3\u008e\u00c2\u00a323bn annual bill for housing benefit, free up living space for overcrowded families, and encourage people to get jobs. But housing charities have warned that the result will be higher levels of rent arrears and greater homelessness. The government estimates that over half a million tenants are affected by the new rules, which took effect in April this year. More than half of those affected have a disability causing them \"significant difficulty in one or more areas of the individual's life\", the Department for Work and Pensions has said. The government predicts that savings to the taxpayer will amount to \u00c2\u0092\u00c3\u00a4\u00c3\u008e\u00c2\u00a3505m in 2013-14, and \u00c2\u0092\u00c3\u00a4\u00c3\u008e\u00c2\u00a3540m in the year after. What has changed? The new rules affect housing benefit, which is paid to less well-off tenants to help with rent. Typically claimants receive between \u00c2\u0092\u00c3\u00a4\u00c3\u008e\u00c2\u00a350 and \u00c2\u0092\u00c3\u00a4\u00c3\u008e\u00c2\u00a3100 a week. But since April 2013 families deemed to have too much living space by their local authorities receive a reduced payment.  Under the government's so-called \"size criteria\", families are assessed for the number of bedrooms they actually need. Who is affected? This change affects council tenants, and those who rent from housing associations, who are housing benefit claimants. It does not affect private sector tenants who are already subject to certain rules. The government estimates that 660,000 households will have their benefit cut, roughly a third of social sector claimants. Only those of working age will see reduced payments. But there are some other exemptions too. Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith said the 5,000 approved foster carers in the UK would continue to receive rent payments towards an \"additional room\" as long as they have fostered a child or become an approved foster carer in the previous 12 months. And families with adult children serving in the armed forces will also be exempt from the changes, even when they are on overseas deployment.

If we fished every year there would only be very small fish here,\" the 78 year old told me as two men in dug out canoes adjusted the nets inside a section of the lake that had been fenced off with cane reeds.

Defence officials said the troops landed in helicopters and lay in wait as Qaduli drove past them in a car. There was an attempt to capture Qaduli alive, but the situation escalated and the militant and three other people in the vehicle were killed, the officials added.

Recorded sexual offences rose by 53%, while burglary rose by 6%, vehicle offences fell by 24% and public order offences dropped by 18%. A recent inspection by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) said Dyfed-Powys Police recognised it needed to work with partners in order to prevent crime and reduce anti-social behaviour. The review found that it uses a range of alternative methods to divert offenders from the criminal justice system, and has invested significant resources into establishing strong partnership arrangements for managing the most prolific offenders. But it said there needs to be improvements made in the way the force identifies vulnerability and how it allocates crime for investigation.\n", "summary": "Police chief Dafyddie Llywelyn has been named Dyfed-Polywyc's new police commissioner.<br/>", "label": "factually incorrect", "errors": ["Extrinsic entity error", "Extrinsic entity error"]}

The club, who went into liquidation last month, say they will \"deal with the ramifications\" of the announcement before deciding whether to respond. A phoenix entity, named Rugby 1885 Limited, had been granted a temporary licence on 22 December to play their last two league games after Welsh went into liquidation, although the club were deducted 20 points. On expelling the club from the second tier, the RFU stated the Old Deer Park side were unable to provide a bond or show evidence they would be able to pay rugby creditors in full. Welsh said they had worked \"very closely\" with RFU chief executive Ian Ritchie, director of professional rugby Nigel Melville and legal and governance director Angus Bujalski in order to to meet the conditions.

Welsh have suffered financial difficulties since then and had hoped to secure investment from a United States-based group, but that deal collapsed in November. Exiles coach Sonny Parker criticised the RFU of acting \"through self-interest\" and announcing the decision with \"no regard to those impacted\".

{"article": "First, will the Bundestag, the German parliament, back the proposed bailout, absent support from the IMF? The behaviour of Mrs Merkel, in forcing the Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras against his wishes to accept future IMF involvement in the bailout, suggests she believes IMF endorsement and involvement is the sine qua non of Bundestag approval. And if the Bundestag says \"Nein\", we are back in the territory of Greece careering towards the euro door marked exit and penury. Second, if the IMF is saying - as it effectively does in its debt sustainability update - that Greece is insolvent without a massive debt write-off, and a write-off that eurozone governments show no sign of embracing, can the European Central Bank in good conscience increase emergency lending to banks, or Emergency Liquidity Assistance? Now Greek banks have been led to believe by the Bank of Greece that the ECB would increase ELA by around 2bn euros either today or tomorrow. If this happens, it will be a significant fillip to the Greek economy. Because the banks are planning to re-open their doors in those circumstances - either tomorrow (now unlikely) or Monday. It would not be banking and business as usual. But some of the economically devastating effects of capital controls - most of which would be retained - would be limited. Here is what the banks will do if the ECB provides just a bit more emergency lending. First, the government committee currently approving - or more accurately not approving - requests by businesses for the banks to finance imports would have its powers transferred back to the banks. Subject to rules, the banks would then start to provide finance again to companies wanting to import goods and raw materials deemed vital to Greece's economic interests. Which means the twin dangers would recede of the economy grinding to a halt for want of imports and of a humanitarian crisis caused by a shortage of medicines and foods. Second, cashiers would start to receive cheques again, and people could withdraw their maximum of 60 euros per account over the counter, and not just at cash machines. To be clear, the 60 euro limit on withdrawals would remain, perhaps for months. And transferring money abroad would remain heavily restricted. But the banks could start to provide some basic support to the economy, rather than almost none as at present.

Mrs Gildernew was absent from the committee on Wednesday. The PAC has been running an investigation into the handling of the non-domestic RHI for several months. The green energy scheme was intended to increase the creation of heat from renewable sources. However, businesses were receiving more in subsidies than they were paying for renewable fuel and the scheme became majorly oversubscribed.

Mrs Lockhart told the committee on Wednesday her brother-in-law had been a recipient of the heat subsidy since 2014, but she had been unaware of that fact until January 2017. She was responding to a request from UUP MLA and committee chair Robin Swann for any committee member with an interest in the scheme to declare it. Mrs Lockhart said as well as being unaware of her relative's involvement with RHI, she did not \"help or assist with the application process\". \"My mother and father have poultry farms and do not have RHI and I can let any journalist see my bank statements and they will see there's no benefit from RHI,\" she said.

He stressed that a false statement of fact must be \"directly related\" to the personal character or conduct of a candidate. Ms Sturgeon, the leader of the SNP and Scotland's first minister, was not a candidate in May's general election. The QC said it would have been the \"easiest thing in the world\" for the Act to make it clear if a false statement could be about non-candidates.

It's a wider problem that's becoming far too prevalent.\" Linlithgow Rose manager David McGlynn said the club would try to track down those responsible for throwing the smoke bombs, while club president Les Donaldson attempted to challenge the perpetrators at Station Park. \"It's just shocking to think that a club who has tried so hard to go forward, to make facilities so good for every person who comes along to eventually be brought down by a bunch of hooligans who have no interest whatsoever in watching football, all they were there for was causing trouble,\" Donaldson told BBC Radio Scotland on Wednesday. \"All I wanted to do was try to show solidarity with the stewards and the police and try to get these people to realise how they were letting a club down that has\n", "summary": "Forfar Football Club have been sparked by the ongoing protest over the use of fire extinguishers at the stadium.<br/>", "label": "too incoherent", "errors": []}
{"article": "Mr Kejriwal spent Monday night in the open and conducted business with cabinet members from the street. His administration had accused the police of failing to deal with an alleged drugs and prostitution ring - something they denied. The chief minister says he has won concessions from central government. By Soutik BiswasIndia correspondent India's Arvind Kejriwal's 'anarchic' politics The government, which commands Delhi's police force, has agreed to send on leave two police officers Mr Kejriwal wants suspended on allegations of misconduct. \"I'm very happy today. Today the people of Delhi have won. I want to congratulate the people of Delhi,\" AFP news agency quotes Mr Kejriwal as telling supporters. The protest began on Monday when Mr Kejriwal was prevented from going to the home minister's office to demand the officers' suspension. He was acting in response to an incident which threatened to become a diplomatic issue, putting his Aam Aadmi Party, the police and members of Delhi's African community at loggerheads. Last Wednesday Mr Kejriwal's Law Minister, Somnath Bharti, and various party supporters allegedly confronted four Ugandan women in a Delhi neighbourhood, accusing them of prostitution. Police refused to search a nearby house for evidence of the suspected drugs and prostitution ring because they did not have a warrant. Mr Bharti and supporters of the Aam Aadmi Party were accused of threatening and intimidating the women, forcing their way into homes and making racist remarks - allegations they deny. Mr Kejriwal's wider demands include police reform and transferring control of Delhi's police force from the federal authorities. The chief minister also accuses the police of failing to protect women, following the fatal gang-rape of a student in December 2012. The Aam Aadmi Party, or Common Man's Party, performed unexpectedly well in state elections on an anti-corruption platform, propelling Mr Kejriwal to the post of chief minister last month. India's general election must take place by May and the party, only one year old, is expected to field a large number of candidates. The protest in Delhi is thought likely to raise its profile as the national poll approaches. While hailed as a victory by some, Mr Kejriwal's protest has been criticised by others, who urged him to get off the streets in order to govern as he was elected to do. His sit-in had caused congestion in central Delhi as police barricaded roads to the site.

{"article": "The coin, said to date from the dawn of English Christianity, was unearthed in East Grafton by a metal detectorist. Richard Bishop, from auctioneers Spink and Sons, said the final sale price was a \"magnificent achievement\" for such a \"small but perfectly formed gold thrymsa\". Wiltshire Museum bought the coin after a fundraising campaign. It features a head motif with a Christian cross and is believed to have been struck in modern-day France. Experts believe it was in circulation just after the burial of King Raedwald at Sutton Hoo around AD 625. Only five examples of this type of coin have ever been found. Wiltshire Museum director David Dawson, said they were \"delighted\" to have bought the \"important coin\", which he said will help experts understand the importance of the Vale of Pewsey and the Kingdom of Wessex in the Saxon period. The museum had donations from all over the world, including grants from Arts Council England, Victoria and Albert Purchase Grant Fund and the Art Fund. Stephen Deuchar, director of the Art Fund, said: \"Very few coins of such quality exist...
