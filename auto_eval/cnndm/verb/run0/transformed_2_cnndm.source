( cnn ) iraqi forces say they 've captured key areas in their offensive to take back tikrit , which has been under isis control since june . the security forces , backed by shia militias , raised the iraqi flag over the governorate and the main hospital buildings in the city monday night , a security official with the forces in tikrit told cnn . the gains , according to the official , came after a slow advance into the city as the forces dealt with more than 300 improvised explosive devices planted in the city 's streets . at least 26 militants were killed in the operation , the official said . earlier monday , iraqi federal police said in a statement aired on iraqi television that the forces had liberated four neighborhoods in southern tikrit . the renewed push into tikrit comes days after a series of u.s.-led airstrikes aimed at isis targets around the city . the goal of those airstrikes was to pave the way for iraqi forces to go in . now security forces and fighters from hashd al-shaabi , a predominantly shia paramilitary force that has doing much of the fighting in the critical battle to take tikrit back from isis , say they 're gaining ground . iraqi forces have tried multiple times to win back tikrit since isis , which calls itself the islamic state , conquered the city in june as part of its campaign to amass an expansive islamic caliphate . and each time , so far , they 've failed . the latest push began after iraqi prime minister haider al-abadi on march 1 ordered iraqi forces to retake tikrit and salahuddin province . militants have been under pressure ever since in the battleground city , which is the birthplace of former iraqi dictator saddam hussein and located about 160 kilometers ( 100 miles ) north of baghdad . isis responded by adjusting its positions in and around the city , hiding in buildings and other key infrastructure , said saad al-hadithi , a spokesman for al-abadi . this movement led iraq 's military to pause its operation , out of growing worries that a full-on invasion could produce heavy iraqi military and some civilian casualties . the situation spurred the iraqi prime minister to request help from the u.s.-led coalition , which conducted airstrikes around tikrit last week . cnn 's jomana karadsheh , catherine e. shoichet , ashley fantz , ben wedeman and greg botelho contributed to this report .
three in four households are paying up to # 250 a year more on gas and electricity than they have to , official figures reveal . most families are still on their energy firm 's standard variable tariff -- two years after david cameron promised to force suppliers to put all customers on the best deal . the standard packages are # 180 a year more expensive than the cheapest tariff , with some customers paying nearly # 250 a year more . three in four households are paying up to # 250 a year more on gas and electricity than they have to , because they are on a standard variable tariff rather than the cheapest deal shadow energy secretary caroline flint said mr cameron had promised 17 times in the house of commons to make energy suppliers automatically put all customers on their supplier 's lowest tariff . she said : ` more than two years after david cameron promised to make energy companies put all customers on the lowest tariff , millions of households are still being routinely overcharged by hundreds of pounds every single year . ` that 's why the next labour government will freeze energy prices until 2017 , so that bills can fall but not rise , give the regulator the power to force energy suppliers to cut their prices and end overcharging once and for all . ' last month the competition and markets authority released early findings of an inquiry into the sector that the big six were overcharging millions of loyal customers by up to # 234 a year . during prime minster 's question 's time , david cameron pledged to force energy firms to put customers on the cheapest tariff its findings showed 95 % of the uk 's 19 million dual fuel customers - those who take gas and electricity from the same company - could have saved between # 158 and # 234 by switching tariff or supplier . the cma found the big six had consistently charged higher prices for standard variable tariffs than for other deals such as fixed tariffs . energy uk chief executive lawrence slade said : ` standard variable tariffs are just that , the standard price a company is offering energy to customers . labour 's caroline flint said mr cameron had promised 17 times to make energy suppliers put all customers on the lowest tariff ` part of the cost of energy is an assurance that the gas and electricity has been bought months in advance , making sure energy will be available to customers when it is needed . ` new fixed-price deals are able to take advantage of short-term changes in costs and usually offer lower prices than the standard deals , often for a year or two . ` however , the important thing for customers to remember is there are a wide range of deals available in the market . ` if a customer thinks they might be able to save some money by switching tariff or company , they should log on to a comparison site or call their supplier . ' ofgem chief executive dermot nolan said : ` while recent price cuts are a step in the right direction , many customers could be better off to the tune of up to # 250 by moving from a variable rate to a fixed rate deal . ` if you 're not sure where to start , then i 'd strongly recommend the be an energy shopper website for an independent and impartial guide . ' a decc spokeswoman said : ` our reforms to drive down household bills are working and the best energy tariffs are cheaper than they were a year ago . but people want to see more savings - now - and the power is in their hands to do something about it . by shopping around for a better deal and switching energy suppliers households can save around # 200 and some even more . ` consumers deserve a fair deal - and this is exactly why we 're backing the cma 's investigation . ' despite wholesale energy prices falling sharply , household energy bills are not dropping at the same rate -- nor at the same level across providers . anyone on a standard tariff with a big six provider -- british gas , e.on , npower , sse , edf energy and scottishpower -- who has not switched for several years can almost certainly save money by jumping ship . households should really review deals every year to ensure they are n't overpaying , but even moving every other year will save you significant amounts . remember , suppliers offer their cheapest rates via online tariffs . prices are different all over the country and the cheapest supplier for you will depend where you live . you can check how prices compare using the tool on the right .
aston villa manager tim sherwood has united the dressing room and inspired the players , according to defender jores okore . back-to-back premier league wins - either side of an fa cup quarter-final victory - have halted the club 's slide towards the relegation zone . sherwood 's first two matches were the tail-end of a seven-match losing run , itself part of a sequence of 12 games without a win stretching back to early december which ultimately cost paul lambert his job . tim sherwood celebrates after seeing his aston villa side take the lead against sunderland defender jores okore ( left ) says sherwood 's passion has rubbed off on all the players although villa remain just three points above the bottom three , okore insists the squad believe they will survive . ` he has come in with a positive mind and he has spoken to everyone and got them all on board , ' he told avfc.co.uk . ` he brought the team together and maximised the strength and potential of the squad . ` he has so much passion . it rubs off on everyone - it has with the fans and the players . ` he 's inspiring ; that helps to get us on board with his vision . i think that passion will continue . ` he has come in with positive energy and really gone out there and said ` look guys , i really believe in this and i want you to believe it too . if we do this together , we can achieve the goals we set ' . the former tottenham boss passionately celebrates as villa score their fourth against sunderland sherwood has recorded back-to-back premier league wins to lift villa three points clear of the drop zone ` he made us believe that strongly . everyone is on the same page .

' wei , who was raised with three older sisters and a younger brother , is also clear on his responsibilities to his mothers , even if he is n't quite sure how it will work . ` i 'll try to take care of both mothers , they are both my mothers . i 'm still coming up with a solid plan , and my birth-mother respects my choice , ' he said .
a spaghetti bolognese dinner between two flatmates turned nasty when one drunkenly attacked the other with a meat cleaver . peter mckay , 35 , had been living with leslie bidgood for around six months in sheppey , kent , when he savagely attacked his friend while chopping ingredients for their dinner . both men had been drinking vodka and mckay was also taking sedatives when he struck his friend of four years with the meat cleaver , causing injuries to his head and neck and leaving him ` lucky to be alive ' . maidstone crown court ( pictured ) heard peter mckay had been living with leslie bidgood for around six months in sheppey , kent , when he attacked his friend while chopping ingredients for their dinner mr bidgood , who was watching television when the attack took place on september 18 last year , managed to run from the flat covered in blood . but he was pursued by mckay , who held him up against a fence and shouted : ` what 's my name ? ' before punching him in the head . mckay also threatened witnesses who tried to help the victim . the men had previously downed several vodka red bulls each and mckay was also taking sedative tablets . maidstone crown court heard mckay emerged from the kitchen ` growling ' before attacking mr bidgood . mark mullins , prosecuting , said : ` he went up to mr bidgood and started hitting him around the neck and head . ` mr bidgood saw blood on his hands . he felt it dripping down from his face . ' ` he tried to push him away . he said : " we are mates . we are both on the same side " . mr mckay did n't stop . he just kept growling . ' mckay had been preparing a spaghetti bolognese for their dinner when he turned on his flatmate ` the victim could not remember anything else until he woke up in hospital with cuts to his neck , behind his left ear and above his left eye , which needed stitches . ' mr mullins told the jury the ` very nasty attack ' could have had much more serious consequences . mckay claimed he was intoxicated due to the consumption of the tablets and alcohol which led to a state of ` automatism ' . but mr mullins said : ` the prosecution say it was a voluntary act on his part . ` this is not a case of someone who suddenly lost their inhibitions and did n't know what he was doing . ` when he stabbed him he intended to cause him grievous bodily harm . someone who stabs someone multiple times with a meat cleaver intends to do someone really serious harm . ' giving evidence mr bidgood told the court he got on well with mckay , there were no issues between the pair and they would often enjoy watching television and playing video games together . he said : ` even on medication , he was always happy . ` we were together all day . we went to the shop to get some drink and some mince for spaghetti bolognese . ' i do n't remember how much we had to drink before we went . i think i had a couple of vodkas and red bull . when we got back i went onto my tablet and played a game . ` he did the same . we had a chat and a laugh . i do n't know how much we had to drink . i would say a fair bit . i am not really a drinker . ` he was in the kitchen preparing dinner . i could hear him cutting up onion . he was popping in and out and chatting . there was nothing to indicate all was not well with his mind . ' i remember him coming in and saying " it 's all your fault " . ' i tried to calm him down and told him we are mates . he was holding a meat cleaver . ' i got up and said : " what 's going on " . i just do n't remember much . i do n't remember being attacked , but i know i was . ` all i know is i wanted to get out of the flat . i do n't remember going downstairs . i know i felt it . i do n't remember him hitting me . i just came round at the hospital . ' mr bidford needed three stitches by his adam 's apple , seven on the side of his head and butterfly stitches on his eye . ` they have all healed up , ' he added . ` there is a little scar . ' mckay denied causing grievous bodily harm but was found guilty by a jury at maidstone crown court and will be sentenced on april 27 . detective constable mark silk from kent police said : ` there is no doubt a substantial amount of alcohol , combined with a number of sedative pills proved to be a potent cocktail and played a part in mckay 's state of mind that night . ` however , that should in no way be used as an excuse . he was fully conscious and had in his possession a lethal weapon and using it meant he fully intended to cause harm . ` it must have been a terrifying shock and ordeal to have seen someone change in that way and see them attacking you . ` in fact , the victim was incredibly lucky the attack was not fatal . ' i am pleased the jury were able to see the seriousness of the offence and convict him on the comprehensive evidence put before them . '

' he also noticed that her son was covered in blood on the ground but was opening his eyes . he picked up the boy 's limp body - all while green did nothing , smith said . when eric was well enough to speak to police , he named the man and picked his photo from a lineup . he told nbc that he had been sleeping when green walked in and switched on the light , giving him a good view of his mother 's killer . but a defense team today would raise issues with garrett 's claims , considering his age , the passage of time and the injuries he sustained in the attack , experts told nbc . questions : no one has ever been charged in the murder of paula garrett , left , or the attack on her son eric , when he was four . her boyfriend was initially arrested but was freed after passing a lie detector test two months after the death , green was arrested and charged with his girlfriend 's murder , although he protested his innocence . his wife and children also stood by him . during a bond hearing , a neighbor testified that they saw green rushing away from the home around 3am on the night of the murder . he underwent two polygraph tests , both of which he failed . but there were questions over how the tests were carried out so police took him to chicago for a further test . after taking it , green went to the restroom and escaped police custody . the next day , after it emerged he had passed the third test , police spoke to him on the phone and convinced him to turn himself in . he was taken back to indiana where prosecutors dropped the charges - to the anger of police , the star press reported . despite the decision , eric 's father , robbie garrett , said that his son maintained green ` sent my mommy to heaven ' . in 1981 , the case was turned over to a countywide homicide investigation team after a grand jury decided the original probe was ` incomplete and one-sided ' . the city later withdrew this decision . prosecutor michael alexander told nbc that there was no specific evidence indicating green was the killer . he suggested that the killing could have been motivated by a robbery or a sexual assault . testimony : neighbors said they often heard the young single mother , pictured with her son , arguing with her boyfriend , while one testified that he saw the boyfriend , richard green , near her apartment that night ' i was pretty well convinced he did n't commit the crime based on evidence at the scene , ' he said . ' i did n't like the idea of charging someone on phony evidence . ' police officers from the original case and members of eric 's family have since called for officials to reopen the case , and delaware county prosecutor jeff arnold said that he has met with eric and has asked police to look for further leads . but right now there is no new evidence to bring charges , he said . after the attack , eric , who was struck as many as 15 times with the blunt object , was left with partial paralysis on his right side and still has nine dimples on his head where his skull was fractured . he was raised by relatives and graduated high school . he still lives in the area with his dog . green refused to speak with nbc and his daughter told reporters to stop contacting them .
the theft of a handwritten letter by the renaissance master , michelangelo could only have been an inside job , the former head of the vatican museums has said . the return of two letters stolen from an archive in 1997 , has been offered by a former vatican employee for between euro 100,000 ( # 72,000 ) and 200,000 ( # 144,000 ) . the vatican authorities discovered that it was missing from the offices of the fabbrica of st peter 's basilica 18 years ago but did not publicise the theft . the former director of the vatican museums has said the theft of letters written by michelangelo from its archives must have been carried out by ` an inside man ' . above , a file image of one of its archives former director of the vatican museums , franco buranelli , said : ` these areas [ of the archive ] are not easy to access . ` it must have been an inside man working in the archives who knew how to gain possession of the document and be able to get it out without creating havoc . ' he said the letter was of ` immense ' value although it would be impossible for thieves to sell . ` every letter by michelangelo is of immense value . the loss of any nugget by the great renaissance masters is serious . ` there is no realistic prospect of a sale ' , he told rome-based newspaper il messaggero . but in any case the value of the letter ` is difficult to estimate because it depends on ` the content , intended recipient , period and the presence or not of signatures , sketches , designs or sonnets . ' he said that the letter would probably not have been a family letter but likely referring to art commissioned by the pope . ` it could be on architectural matters or a service note for the acquisition of materials that he needed to complete a work . ' mr buranelli said while the letters could not be sold they were of ` immense value ' . a former employee has come forward almost 15 years after they were stolen , claiming he knows where they are a nun working in the archivio della fabbrica , the body set up by pope julius ii in 1506 to maintain the basilica of st peter 's informed the then head-cardinal noe of the disappearance in 1997 . then a few months ago an ex-vatican employee contacted its head , cardinal angelo comastri , saying he knew what had become of the letter and wanted a reward . ` cardinal comastri recently received a proposal for the return of the letter in exchange for payment , " father federico lombardi , the vatican spokesman , said . ` naturally he refused , as these are documents that have been stolen .

manchester united are the most popular english football club worldwide and also the wealthiest . they are comfortably ahead of all their rivals in both these categories , with just four contenders in the pack behind them vying to be authentic ` global ' names with financial clout to match . that quartet are chelsea , arsenal , liverpool and manchester city . popularity has been measured by combined followings on facebook and twitter - the two biggest social media platforms , used by more than a billion people - while wealth has been measured by income in the most recently completed season , namely 2013-14 . manchester united are closing in on five million followers on social media site twitter united have also attracted a staggering 63 million likes on facebook at the other end of the scale , northampton town have fewer than 30,000 followers on twitter the clubs ' global fanbases and wealth have been considered as part of a sportsmail study to explore which english clubs are the ` biggest ' ; 58 different teams of the current 92 in the top four divisions have been included in the study , having played in england 's top division for at least a season . united were slower than most clubs in embracing social media , not setting up an official facebook page until 2010 and only starting an official twitter account in 2012 . but with a following now of more than 70 million people across those two platforms , united are way ahead of chelsea in second place ( 47m ) , arsenal ( 38m ) , liverpool ( 30m ) and city ( 21m ) . there is then a big drop-off before tottenham in sixth ( 7.5 m ) and another drop off before aston villa , everton and newcastle , each with between two and three million ` followers ' on official social network platforms . no other teams have as many as two million , although every club in the country now has an official facebook and twitter presence and all clubs have at least tens of thousands of followers on these sites . manchester city are the defending premier league champions but trail their rivals united in the money table the full details for all the clubs in sportsmail 's study are in the accompanying tables . ` big ' clubs almost by definition will have lots of supporters of one kind or another ; increasingly these are spread around the world , fans whose primary engagement with the teams they follow being via television and the internet . it is notable how significant membership or recent membership of the premier league appears to be in influencing the number of social media followers . swansea , hull , fulham , qpr , stoke and norwich all make the top 20 in our list whereas multiple former english title winners including leeds , wolves and blackburn do not . does that mean swansea are ` bigger ' than leeds ? as a straightforward proposition , most neutrals would agree not . but it goes without saying the swansea , currently , as a stable , well-run premier league club are currently ` bigger ' , ie : higher up , richer , better marketed to a worldwide audience as part of the global commodity that is the premier league . similarly , any club currently in the premier league or there very recently is likely to be richer than clubs that are not and have not been . united lead the way in income , earning # 433m in revenues last season , ahead of city in second place then chelsea , arsenal and liverpool . southampton , swansea , stoke and crystal palace all make the top 15 clubs on this measure where again the likes of wolves , blackburn and leeds are in the lower reaches of the top 30 .

south africa skipper ab de villiers ' accomplished showing with bat and ball helped the proteas to a 146-run world cup victory over the united arab emirates in wellington . de villiers underpinned south africa 's innings with a sparkling 82-ball 99 as they reached 341 for six , before taking two for 15 from three overs as the uae were bowled out for 195 in response with 15 balls remaining . de villiers surprisingly fell one run short of his century , but will take consolation from having smashed four sixes to take his total to 20 at this showpiece - the most at the tournament - and a record 36 in 21 world cup matches overall . south africa captain ab de villiers ( right ) inspired his country to a comfortable win against the uae the explosive batsman hit 99 for the proteas as they continued they impressive form in the world cup de villers also took two wickets with the ball at the wellington regional stadium on thursday the victory was as comfortable as the margin suggests for south africa as the uae slumped to a fifth defeat in as many world cup games . the proteas , already through to the knockout phase , set the formidable target after being asked to bat first at westpac stadium . de villiers shared a 108-run fourth-wicket stand with david miller , after hashim amla ( 12 ) , quinton de kock ( 26 ) and rilee rossouw ( 43 ) had departed , and added a further 53 in partnership with jp duminy . miller was dismissed one run short of his half-century at the start of the 37th over , bowled by mohammad naveed , who claimed figures of three for 63 . de villiers had been let off the hook on 63 when he offered a caught-and-bowled chance trying to go down the ground to amjad javed , and looked set to notch his hundred only to slice a wide length ball from kamran shazad straight to javed at short third man . his departure signalled the arrival of farhaan behardien , though , and his quick-fire 64 not out from just 31 deliveries kept the south african score racing along . farhaan bahardien also shone for south africa with the bat in wellington uae have lost all five of their world cup games so far this year and were 45-3 after 12.3 overs duminy ( 23 ) became naveed 's third victim when he was trapped lbw , but behardien and vernon philander ( 10 not out ) took the total past 300 in an unbroken 49-run seventh-wicket stand . the uae 's long-shot chances of chasing down that total were dealt a heavy blow as they slumped to 45 for three after just 12.3 overs . morne morkel led the early charge for the proteas , dismissing andri berenger ( five ) and khurram khan ( 12 ) as he took two for four from his first four overs , while duminy claimed amjad ali 's ( 21 ) wicket in between . shaiman anwar and swapnil patil put on 63 in a fourth-wicket stand that provided a brief respite , but when anwar ( 39 ) sent imran tahir 's delivery straight to mid-wicket they began to tumble again . saqlain haider ( seven ) replaced anwar at the crease , but he only lasted three overs to become de villiers ' first victim of the day , before javed ( five ) followed suit soon after to leave the uae on 125 for six with 15.4 overs left . de villiers rounded off his display with a simple catch as naveed ( 17 ) top-edged philander tamely to mid-wicket and the subsequent departures of mohammad tauqir ( three ) and shazad ( nought ) meant the uae fell short of completing their 50 overs . swapnil patil wsa the only plus point in the batting display as he passed 50
following sunday 's el clasico spectacle that hugely intensified the run-in for the la liga title between barcelona and real madrid , rio ferdinand gave his stance on the age-old debate of who is better : cristano ronaldo or lionel messi ? choosing to stay somewhat impartial to the discussion the former england international says we should stand back and appreciate the sheer brilliance we are witnessing in the presence of two of the world 's greatest ever players . ` it 's inevitable we do all this " who 's better ? blah , blah , blah " but we should just be enjoying being around these two players and seeing it , ' the qpr defender said . rio ferdinand ( right ) speaks to the camera alongside queen 's park rangers team-mate bobby zamora lionel messi is la liga 's top scorer this season with 32 goals but cristiano ronaldo is not far behind the real madrid striker 's goal in el clasico on sunday took him to just one goal behind the barcelona forward ` when ronaldo , the brazilian one - who should have been the best if he were n't injured - was scoring 30 goals a season [ everybody said ] : " oh he 's a genius , he 's the best ever . " ' messi and ronaldo are this season 's top scorers in la liga , with 32 and 31 goals respectively with 10 games to go . speaking from his car , kitted out with an x-box and television screen , the former manchester united star posted an image on instagram of himself and hoops team-mate bobby zamora . the two were taking each other on in an in-car game of fifa whilst travelling to training at the imperial college sports ground , london . the 2008 champions league winner wrote : ` en route to training . winning at fifa #shock ' after beating the former fulham striker 2-1 with paris saint germain . the former england international raises his finger in victory after beating zamora in an in-car game of fifa
it is one of nature 's great ocean explorers , a giant creature that swims 13,000 miles in a year and can live to the age of 100 . but rather than roaming the seven seas , this 34-stone leatherback sea turtle is undergoing treatment in a us aquarium after it swallowed a floating plastic bag . the leatherback , nicknamed yawkey , was found dangerously ill on a remote beach in south carolina . the rare leatherback sea turtle , nicknamed yawkey ( pictured ) , was found stranded on a remote beach the huge turtle , weighing an estimated 500 pounds , is now being treated at south carolina aquarium rescuers believe yawkey may have accidentally eaten plastic having mistaken it for his favourite food jellyfish rescuers tend to yawkey at the aquarium where he is being treated with fluids and antibiotics yawkey floats in the small tank set up for him at the south carolina aquarium in charleston experts said it became stranded after it mistook a billowing plastic bag for the jellyfish it feeds on -- a common problem which kills countless sea turtles every year . eating plastic could cause a build-up of gas in the digestive tract , making the turtle buoyant and washing it to shore . the incident is a stark illustration of the damage humans are doing to the environment by dumping millions of tons of plastic rubbish into our oceans . recent studies estimate 8million tons of bags , bottles , toys and other rubbish ends up in the seas each year -- affecting up to 400 different marine species , many of them endangered . the daily mail has been campaigning since 2008 for tougher action to reduce plastic bag waste . a major victory in the banish the bags campaign came in june last year when a 5p charge for plastic bags was announced in england . the charge , which will be introduced by october , is expected to reduce bag use by up to 80 per cent and raise up to # 100million a year for good causes . the aquarium hopes to release yawkey soon because leatherbacks do not cope well in captivity wildlife experts rescued the rare leatherback from a beach on saturday . kelly thorvalson , a turtle expert at the south carolina aquarium sea turtle hospital in charleston , said it took five people to haul the giant beast from the beach . they rode in a 4x4 truck through mud and marshland to get to the leatherback , before using a winch to get it on to the vehicle . there were few signs of external injury to the beast , leading conservationists to conclude it had probably swallowed a plastic bag . ` leatherbacks feed primarily on jellyfish so it is very possible that plastics -- such as bags that look like jellyfish -- could be causing a gastro-intestinal issue , ' mrs thorvalson added . leatherbacks , the biggest of all the sea turtles , swim in six of the seven oceans , roaming up to 13,000 miles a year in their search for food and nesting sites . the leatherback turtle 's dark blue shell is leathery to the touch -- giving it its name . the animal is officially endangered , with global populations of nesting females having dropped from 115,000 in 1980 to as few as 34,000 in recent years . yawkey has responded well to antibiotics and other treatment , and the aquarium hopes to release it in the next few days .
phil parkinson may have snubbed jose mourinho 's offer of a handshake before the final whistle sounded on bradford city 's shock fa cup win over chelsea , but the 47-year-old will gladly borrow some of the special one 's tricks as he tries to guide the league one club to wembley again . parkinson faces reading -- where he spent 11 years as a player -- at valley parade on saturday knowing that another upset would see bradford return to the national stadium in the semi-finals of the fa cup for the first time in more than a century . remarkably , he has already taken bradford there twice in the capital one cup final and league two playoff final in 2013 . bradford boss phil parksinon ( centre left ) rebuffed jose mourinho 's ( right ) handshake during their fa cup tie parkinson did not want to be distracted by mourinho 's premature offer of congratulations when bradford came from behind to record a stunning 4-2 win at stamford bridge in january , before going on to take another premier league scalp in sunderland in the fifth round . but the bradford manager can not help but admire the chelsea manager 's win-at-all-costs mentality compared with some managers ( look away louis van gaal ) who are obsessed with imposing their ` philosophy ' on a club . ` i like the fact that he will do whatever it takes to win , ' said parkinson . ` we are in an era of managers who sometimes their own philosophy gets in the way of what 's the most important thing to win each individual game . phil parkinson believes the big teams in the premier league are jealous of bradford chelsea were beaten 4-2 by league one outfit bradford during the fourth round back in january ` mourinho sets up his team to win . the capital one cup final ( against tottenham ) was a good example of that . ` for me , that 's what management is about . not just saying " we 've got good players , go and play " . it 's about what tweaks and adaptations are we going to make today to give us the best chance of winning ? that 's why i like looking at what mourinho does because he has great skill at that . ' it 's one reason why parkinson is happy to let talk of the poor playing surface at valley parade carry on ahead of reading 's visit . he believes that it got into the heads of sunderland 's players in the last round and contributed to bradford 's 2-0 win . ` i think more was made of the pitch for the sunderland game , ' he added . ` by the time their lads came to the game it was probably a bigger thing than it actually it was . we 'd had a dry week and it was n't too bad . ` if you look around , a lot of pitches are not in a great state at the moment and we 've got some good technical players . ` we 've found that rather than saying " god , i just need big strong physical players on the pitch " , you need technical players that can handle the bad pitch and we 've tried to get our best technical team out there . ' filipe morais , pictured after scoring against chelsea , faces a late fitness test on a knee injury mourinho is n't the only premier league boss that parkinson admires . the ambitious bradford boss has also modelled his managerial style on sir alex ferguson and was able to study arsene wenger 's situation while scouting for arsenal in 2011 following his departure from charlton . ` obviously i 'm ambitious like every player in the squad and every member of staff , ' said parkinson . ` you 've got to want to be right at the top of your game , and i 'm no different . ` there are many managers i look at . the arsenal experience was great for me because i 'd just left charlton and they gave me the opportunity to work within their scouting network . ` the longer that went on , the more senior premiership targets they sent me to watch . it 's a great insight into how a club like arsenal have to operate because obviously they ca n't compete with manchester city and chelsea so they had to look at the level underneath or the players that were n't obvious to everybody else . ` i really enjoyed that and learned a lot from it . i got offered a couple of jobs within that period but i wanted to see that short-term through with the arsenal experience . ` in terms of managers , sir alex ferguson is an obvious one . his leadership qualities but also the way he evolved as a manager . ` myself and ( assistant ) steve parkin , the rest of the staff , try to have a modern approach with the way we do everything but with an old school mentality of discipline , honesty and commitment . we expect those old school demands from the players . ` with sir alex and manchester united , you look at the discipline and the way the players drove on to the end in every game , and the pride they had in wearing the shirt , but also how he evolved all the time in progressing the club . i think he 's a great one to look at . ' so having won the playoff final with bradford in 2013 just three months after losing the capital one cup final 5-0 to swansea , what are parkinson 's priorities this time around as he tries to take the west yorkshire club to the semi-finals of the fa cup for the first time since 2011 ? he said : ` it 's difficult because when we had the capital one cup final , all the way i was saying " the league is more important " . but when we got to the semi-final we were on the point of making history . ` i want to do both but at this stage , when you 're so close to being in an fa cup semi-final at wembley , this has got to take priority at the moment .

west ham manager sam allardyce has again criticised referee mike dean for his handling of saturday 's london derby defeat by crystal palace . the hammers , currently in ninth place in the premier league , were beaten 3-1 by the eagles at the weekend in a contentious contest . allardyce felt that palace striker glenn murray , scorer of two goals at upton park , before being sent off in the 69th minute , should have been dismissed by dean in the first half for persistent fouling . glenn murray was sent off for crystal palace during the 3-1 win against west ham on saturday sam allardyce was frustrated that murray was not sent off earlier in the game allardyce said : ` the biggest problem for me was that glenn murray should n't have been on the field , not only because of persistent fouling but the level of his fouling . ` mike dean , whom i have a lot of respect for , is a very good referee , but he was too lenient with murray by telling him ` that 's your last chance ' after the first booking . ` in that particular instance , palace have been let off . mike dean has a massive responsibility on the fact that ( murray ) was one of the main reasons why crystal palace won . ` and for me that is something disappointing . the fact a referee warns a player for a tackle he has just made , which normally gets a yellow card , and yet he is only warned because he has just had a yellow card . and that is frustrating . ' murray climbed highest to open the scoring for the visitors in the first half with a header murray got his second and palace 's third when he glanced a header past adrian palace captain mile jedinak was caught on sky sports tv cameras apparently elbowing diafra sakho as they both challenged for the ball in the closing stages . though the incident was not seen at the time by the match officials , the football association have since charged the player with violent conduct -- and palace have until tuesday evening to appeal against that decision . allardyce has welcomed any retrospective punishment , saying that the australian midfielder deserves a ban for acting in a dangerous manner against the senegal striker . he added : ` jedinak was clearly in a position where mike dean could n't see it . i think about how dangerous it was . it was a very dangerous thing he did . he could have seriously injured sakho . and he will have to take the punishment -- because i think he deserves it . ' mile jedinak has been charged by the fa with violent conduct after catching diafra sakho with his elbow the incident went unpunished during the game but jedinak was retrospectively charged elsewhere , in his pre-match press conference , ahead of the visit of chelsea to east london tomorrow night , allardyce spoke about the chats he enjoyed with dave mackay , the former tottenham , derby , hearts and scotland enforcer , who died aged 80 . allardyce said : ' i knew dave . he lived in around nottingham , when i was at notts county for three years ( 1997-1999 ) . i spent many a good night with him talking away about his time in football , about management . ` it 's a sad day . he was a terrific guy not just a terrific a footballer . in life , you take a lot of things from a lot of people . ` if you want to get better , you do n't just read a book or do a masters ' degree at university ; you learn a lot from listening to the experiences of people who have been great in their own careers .

a father-of-two claims he spent the night in a hospital storage room with a brass bell to call for help and his drip dangling from a light fighting . with no other beds available paul ross-bowker slept surrounded by oxygen cannisters and medical supplies , just three days after surgeons removed his appendix . his mother said the conditions were so bad , she ` half expected to see florence nightingale ' . but while expressing her shock at her son 's situation , ms ross-bowker said she can not fault the staff who cared for him . mr ross-bowker was taken to gwynedd hospital in bangor on monday after complaining of pain in his abdomen . paul ross-bowker claims he was moved to a hospital ` storage room ' . his mother pauline , said while she was shocked at her son 's situation she can not fault the care he received from staff at the hospital this picture shows how mr ross-bowker 's drip was attached to a light fitting . a spokesman for the said it was a treatment room where clinical procedures were regularly carried out that night , the 35-year-old had an operation to have his appendix removed , before he was taken back to his bed on one of the hospital wards . his mother pauline said her son was still in excruciating pain the next day , and doctors subsequently discovered his wound was infected . they prescribed him the painkiller morphine , and put him on an antibiotic drip to try and combat the infection . in the early hours of thursday morning staff woke mr ross-bowker and told him he needed to be moved because his bed was needed . but instead of moving the it worker from brynsiencyn on anglesey to another ward , he was taken to a side room . staff told him it was a ` treatment , assessment , storage room ' . a spokesman for the health trust which runs the hospital said the room was a treatment room where clinical procedures are routinely carried out . but not being a part of the general ward , there was no alarm system to call staff so mr ross-bowker was instead given a brass bell to call nurses if he needed to . there were oxygen cannisters on the floor , as well as boxes of medical supplies . and his family said his drip was hung from the ceiling via a light fitting , preventing the 35-year-old from going to the toilet . his mother said while being shocked by her son 's situation , she can not fault the staff who cared for him . she said : ` it was a converted store cupboard which they have shoved an old bed into . the 35-year-old had his appendix removed at gwynedd hospital in bangor , north wales , on monday . but in the early hours of thursday morning he was moved to the side room . he said he was given a brass bell and was surrounded by oxygen cannisters and other medical supplies ` how clean would this room have been ? certainly not as clean as the wards . he had just had surgery and had an infected wound . ` he was given a brass bell and the drip was attached to the light fitting , it was like going back to the dark ages . i half expected to see florence nightingale walking down the corridor . ' she added : ` the doctor came to him the next morning and asked him if he wanted to stay or go home . ` paul said if he had to spend another night in there he would rather go home , despite being in the same amount of pain he was in before his operation . the doctor said he did n't blame him . ` the situation is ridiculous , they have n't got enough beds and are closing wards and hospitals . ' ms ross-bowker contacted ynys môn welsh assembly member rhun ap iorwerth about her son 's experience . he said : ' i was shocked to hear of the conditions that one of my constituents had to endure at gwynedd hospital this week . ` surely this ca n't be right in the 21st century ? especially considering a person is at his or her weakest at hospital , expecting them to use a brass bell to call for help is incredible . ` my constituent was full of praise for the nurses working on the ward , but they are obviously being made to work in difficult conditions with a clear lack of resources , and i will be raising this with the health board as well as the welsh government at the first opportunity . ' professor matthew makin , executive medical director at betsi cadwaladr university health board said : ` firstly we would like to apologise to the patient for any distress caused . ` as part of the health board 's escalation policy , when we 're under significant pressure and unable to off load patients from ambulances , we increase ward capacity in a safe manner , ensuring patient dignity at all times . ` the patient was nursed in an appropriate clinical area on the ward , in this instance a treatment room . ` this practice is only done in extreme circumstances and is closely monitored to ensure patient safety at all times . ` we would like to reassure the public that these instances are temporary and patients are allocated to bed spaces on wards as soon as they become available .

the sight of birds pecking at seed or nuts from a garden feeder fills many people with joy . now , a device called the crow box could enable bird watchers to make money from their hobby , as well as watch birds develop new skills . the training aid can be used to teach crows to collect coins in return for peanuts , or simply test the intelligence of wild corvids . the crow box training aid can be used to teach crows to collect coins in return for peanuts , or simply test the intelligence of wild corvids . people who want to train crows can follow the open-source instructions to make their own box ( pictured left ) which includes a perch and funnel to dispense tasty peanuts ( right ) research has shown that crows have a reasoning ability rivalling that of a human seven-year-old , and the birds can solve tasks previously only thought solvable by people and apes . the box is similar to a vending machine for birds , but crows have to use their brains to earn treats . so far , the brooklyn-based maker of the box has managed to train captive crows to retrieve coins in return for peanuts and hopes that wild crows will learn the same tricks . the sealed wooden and plastic box comprises food dispensers , a 12 volt power supply , two motors , cables and sensors . it is powered and run by a laptop that can be placed up to 50ft ( 15 metres ) away . research has shown that crows ( stock image ) have a reasoning ability rivalling that of a human seven-year-old , and the birds can solve tasks previously only thought solvable by people and apes an experiment by the university of cambridge has proved that members of the crow family , known as corvids , are n't just among the cleverest birds , they are smarter than most mammals and can perform tasks that three and four-year-old children have difficulty with . scientists said that , while having very different brain structures , both crows and primates use a combination of mental tools , including imagination and the anticipation of possible future events , to solve similar problems . other experiments involving the same family of birds found that caledonian crows can use up to three tools in sequence to obtain food , which the university of oxford 's behavioural ecology research group said is the first demonstration of spontaneous sequential tool use in a species other than humans . a study also found that rooks can use stones to raise the level of water in a vessel in order to bring a floating worm into reach . urban-living carrion crows have been witnessed learning to use road traffic for cracking nuts . the device has a perch , a food tray and a funnel , designed to test a crow 's cognitive abilities and incentivise them to learn new tricks . there are four steps ( illustrated ) to training crows to find coins , involving peanut rewards to begin training , the device pushes a few peanuts and two coins into the feeder tray whenever a crow leaves the machine , which ensures food is always on offer and the sound of the machine is linked to the reward so the crow learns to accept it . the machine is then adapted so that it does the same thing when a crow arrives -- training the bird to wait for its reward by visiting the machine . once visiting crows have learned patience , the machine is changed again so it only dispenses coins and not peanuts . this part of the training is the highest risk , because it seemingly removes the incentive of nuts . but the contraption is designed so that if a bird pecks or sweeps coins off the tray -- which is fitted with sensors -- and into a funnel , peanuts are revealed and the bird 's ingenuity is rewarded . this stage is designed to strengthen the relationship between the coins going down the funnel and food . the training is complete when crows bring coins of their own volition to unlock food . they may collect coins scattered nearby by the owners of the machine to encourage their behaviour , or travel further afield to collect bonus treasure . gabi mann , from seattle , washington , feeds the crows that visit her home with peanuts and they bring her gifts in exchange . the eight-year-old has built up collection of more than 70 shiny beads , buttons , pieces of metal , brightly coloured plastic and foam - all left for her by her corvid companions . perhaps the most touching is a metal fragment with the word ` best ' written on it - one half of a pendant that would be completed by the word ` friend ' if reunited with the other part . among her most prized presents from the neighbourhood crows is a pearl-coloured heart . ` it 's showing me how much they love me , ' gabi told the podcast the bittersweet life and the bbc . ` they give me all the special stuff you could ever find . ` we know these are from the crows that sometimes they are rusted and dirty and nothing like what a person would carry around . sometimes we find them on the bird feeder . ' as gabi throws the food for the birds , crowds of crows - known as a murder - gather on telephone lines and the nearby fence . in return the crows now leave trinkets on the empty bird feeder - including a broken light bulb , earrings , pieces of lego , rusted screws , polished rocks and glass beads . the open source experiment is designed to look further into the brains of corvids . ` the more people trying different things the faster we 'll all figure out how to work cooperatively with crows , ' hacker and writer joshua klein writes on the crow box website . ` once we 've got the system optimised for teaching coin collection we can move to seeing how flexibly they can learn other tasks , like collecting garbage , sorting through discarded electronics , or maybe even search and rescue . ' the box is similar to a vending machine for birds , but crows have to use their brains to earn treats . the sealed wooden and plastic box comprises food dispensers , a 12 volt power supply , two motors , cables and sensors . some of the inner workings are shown here members of the crow family are known to be among the cleverest of birds , but scientists are finding that they may have intelligence that rivals most mammals and even young children . an experiment by the university of cambridge showed that crows can perform task that three and four-year-old children have difficulty with . scientists said that , while having very different brain structures , both crows and primates use a combination of mental tools , including imagination and the anticipation of possible future events , to solve similar problems . the programme shows 007 the crow completing the eight stage puzzle in approximately two-and-a-half minutes . the individual processes are detailed in this diagram other experiments involving the same family of birds found that caledonian crows can use up to three tools in sequence to obtain food . a study also found that rooks can use stones to raise the level of water in a vessel in order to bring a floating worm into reach . urban-living carrion crows have been witnessed learning to use road traffic for cracking nuts . the problem-solving creature performed the series of tasks without seeing the fiendishly difficult set up of the course beforehand . the wild crow learned to use individual props during its three months of captivity but had to work out the order in which to use them to complete the challenge and get an inaccessible treat . the animal was later released . in another astonishing test set up by bbc two , a crow called 007 completed an eight stage puzzle in two and a half minutes . it is one of the most complex tests of the animal mind ever devised .

beijing 's forbidden city is following in the footsteps of rome 's colosseum and london 's national gallery and banning the selfie stick . bosses at the palace museum in the city have begun a crackdown on the popular phone accessories over fears that one wrong move could cause lasting damage to the invaluable artifacts in the ancient palace houses . the people 's daily online reports that eagle-eyed staff are keeping watch over photo-enthusiasts in the palace 's narrow or crowded areas , as well as all the indoor exhibitions , to avoid any potentially costly accidents . ban : the forbidden city has said selfie sticks are no longer allowed inside the exhibition rooms or narrow passageways over concerns an unfortunate accident may occur ` selfie sticks will cause safety concerns , whether for tourists or the exhibits , ' shen lixia , deputy director of the museum 's tourist reception department , told china daily . ` it may touch the glass exhibition case and cause damage to the cultural relics . ' she added that as well as being banned in exhibition areas , the sticks would be banned in outdoor areas of the museum - so visitors would be wise not to bother taking them at all . however , the sticks will still be allowed outside the palace in the forbidden city - so tourists can still get the all-important shot of the famous 15th century building in the background . there was speculation that the move could be the first step to a total ban , as has been implemented at other cultural attractions around the world . it is thought the louvre in paris will bring in a ban in the next few weeks , while several football stadiums have banned them over fears the extendable devices could be used as a weapon . but it seems should the forbidden city instill a total ban in mobile-mad china - there are said to be 19,300 versions of the selfie stick available on the country 's answer to ebay , taobao - they would have a fair amount of support . popular : chinese tourists use ` selfie sticks ' to take pictures as they stand on jingshan park , overlooking the forbidden city , in february . there are more than 19,000 versions of the sticks for sale on taobao ` museum photos are good for spreading the cultural messages , but we should pay attention to our ways , ' cao wei , a celebrated sina weibo blogger , told people 's daily .

( cnn ) gov. mike pence unleashed a firestorm on indiana last week when he signed the religious freedom restoration act . critics of the law contend it could be used by individuals and businesses to discriminate -- particularly against the lgbt community of lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender individuals -- on the basis of religion . the ramifications for the hoosier state are just starting to be felt in the form of boycotts , petitions and travel bans . as the controversy mushrooms , here 's what got us to where we are . and where things are headed . last week , pence put his signature on the rfra -- a law that allows indiana businesses to cite their religious freedom as a legal defense . the law states that the government ca n't " substantially burden a person 's exercise of religion " and that individuals who feel like their religious beliefs have been or could be " substantially burdened " can lean on this law to fend off lawsuits . in an opinion piece in the wall street journal , pence says the rfra " ensures that indiana law will respect religious freedom and apply the highest level of scrutiny to any state or local governmental action that infringes on people 's religious liberty . " pence notes that there is no reference to sexual orientation in the law . civil liberties and gay rights groups hold to their stance that the law could be used by businesses to deny service to people based on their sexual orientation and justify that discrimination based on their religious belief . " silence is consent ! " tweets laurel davilia , a commentator on brass knuckles progressives radio . from sports teams to musicians to other cities and states , they fell like dominoes . the ncaa , which is headquartered in indianapolis and set to host its men 's basketball final four in the city this week , said the law could lead it to move events elsewhere in future years . the nba , wnba and nfl issued critical statements too . indianapolis colts owner jim irsay says fans of all stripes are welcome . " the colts have always embraced inclusiveness , tolerance , and a diverse fan base , " irsay tweets . " we welcome all fans to colts nation . a petition posted on change.org hopes to get the big ten conference to move its football championship out of indianapolis . " i think that indiana needs to be told that it must respect all persons regardless of sex , age , religion , gender identity , or sexual orientation , " sean burke of madison , wisconsin , says in the petition . " as a football fan , i think we can send a message by calling on the ncaa and big ten conference to take a stand . " lucas oil stadium in indianapolis is scheduled to host the league 's championship game through the 2021 season . at last check , the petition had more than 11,000 supporters . the mayors of san francisco and seattle have barred spending on travel to indiana . the governors of connecticut and washington state did the same thing . and you can add wilco to the boycott bandwagon . the group is canceling its may 7 show in indianapolis , it says on facebook . " the ` indiana religious freedom restoration act ' feels like thinly disguised legal discrimination to us , " wilco says . " hope to get back to the hoosier state someday soon , when this odious measure is repealed . " cher is among the artists speaking out . her son chaz bono is a transgender man . " #govpence is another example of right wing racism , asault on womans rights & hatred of lgbt americans , " she tweets . indiana 's top two state lawmakers pledged monday to amend the state 's controversial " religious freedom " law to clarify that it can not be used to discriminate against gay people . " this law does not discriminate , and it will not be allowed to do so , " david long , the indiana senate president pro tem , said during a news conference with state house speaker brian bosma . pence had said earlier that he was working with lawmakers to clarify the law . critics still were n't on board with the anti-discrimination claims . opponents of rfra marched around the state capitol . someone even created a satire ad : " indiana . it 's a great place to be a bigot . " the rhetoric has reached such a fever pitch that a front page editorial in tuesday 's edition of the indianapolis star blares the headline : " fix . the editorial suggests the rfra and protections for gays and lesbians can co-exist . the state is at a crossroads it says . " ( n ) o matter its original intent ( the law ) already has done enormous harm to our state and potentially our economic future , " according to the editorial . " only bold action -- action that sends an unmistakable message to the world that our state will not tolerate discrimination against any of its citizens -- will be enough to reverse the damage . " " governor , indiana is in a state of crisis . it is worse than you seem to understand . " you must act with courage and wisdom . you must lead us forward now . you must ensure that all hoosiers have strong protections against discrimination . " the laws can co-exist . and so can we . " some of the gop 's top figures are backing pence despite the controversy . jeb bush and marco rubio have voiced their support . both are considered likely republican candidates for the white house . sen. ted cruz , who announced his candidacy last week , is also on board . " i 'm proud to stand with gov. @mike_pence for religious liberty , and i urge americans to do the same , " cruz tweets . indiana is the 20th state to adopt a " religious freedom restoration " law , most of which are modeled after the religious freedom restoration act , which president bill clinton signed into law in 1993 . but that law passed with the backing of a broad-based coalition and was n't set against the backdrop of gay rights or the wave of marriage equality laws that have swept the country in recent years . adam talbot , a spokesman with the human rights campaign , a gay rights group , stresses that those 20 laws are " dramatically different in their scope and effect . " " calling them similar in this way risks being misleading . indiana is the broadest and most dangerous law of its kind in the country , " talbot says . arkansas ' legislature passed an indiana-style law on friday , which now heads to the state 's governor for approval . despite the controversy , the indiana governor says concerns that his state 's new " religious freedom " law will allow businesses to turn away lgbt customers is the result of a " tremendous amount of misinformation and misunderstanding . " still , he was hard pressed to explain why that was n't the case . given a chance on sunday to add some clarity , pence refused to answer at least six yes-or-no questions from abc 's george stephanopoulos about whether the measure legalizes discrimination against gays and lesbians . jeremy diamond and eric bradner contributed to this report .

' the 25-year-old said she feels her application was refused because her eyes were not focused in the picture due to a condition she has had since birth which makes her unable to move them herself . however officials have disputed her claims , and said the application was rejected because of her expression . miss carter has had to provide letters from her doctor proving her eyesight problems in order to have her application accepted . ' i feel disgusted , ' said miss carter . ' i am a registered blind girl who was refused a passport because my eyes were not correct . ' i have nystagmus from birth which controls the movement of my eyes . it is impossible for me to take a picture where my eyes are focused . ` within the application there was no box to tick about my disability . ' i rang up to see if i needed to do anything to prove my disability and was told no . i even went to the post office to explain my situation and i was told that as long as the photo met the other requirements specified it should be fine . ' nystagmus is an involuntary eye movement condition , which can cause reduced or limited vision . it occurs in infancy or in later life . but officials at the passport office in liverpool in merseyside rejected her initial application because of miss carter 's expression in the photograph she provided . she has spent around # 25 trying to get the photo right and had feared she was not going to be able to go on holiday with a friend to santa ponsa in majorca - her first overseas holiday in 10 years . miss carter , 25 , was born with nystagmus - a condition which means she ca n't focus her eyes independently ' i have now had to write a letter explaining my disability as well as proof from my doctor and see if they will grant me a passport . i have taken new photos , but they are not much better - my eyes are beyond my control , ' added miss carter . ` this matter is disgusting and discrimination against people who have eyesight problems . i should not have to explain a disability from birth to anyone .

' passport office officials have now confirmed that her passport has now been sent out . a home office spokesperson said : ` the letter sent to miss carter to explain why her application was refused stated the photo she had submitted was unacceptable because she did not have a neutral expression . ` this was not related to her visual impairment and , following her complaint , staff from her majesty 's passport office have spoken to her to clarify this .

so here 's the question . if petr cech , at 33 , is available in the summer , and arsenal have a chance of buying him , what should be arsene wenger 's best offer ? jose mourinho says cech can leave chelsea if he wishes , but only for big money as he rates him one of the top three goalkeepers in the world . the three most expensive goalkeepers so far : gianluigi buffon ( # 32.6 m ) , manuel neuer ( # 19m ) and david de gea ( # 18m ) -- although all were 25 or under when they made their move . chelsea manager jose mourinho has said goalkeeper petr cech can leave stamford bridge in the summer david de gea , manuel neuer and ginaluigi buffon are the three most expensive goalkeepers in history cech can not command such a fee at his age . a better marker may be the # 9m liverpool paid for simon mignolet . is cech better than mignolet ? so if chelsea asked for # 10m for a 33-year-old reserve , should arsenal be tempted ? the absence of a world class goalkeeper is holding arsenal back . cech could easily last another four years at the top , making him value at # 10m . pat jennings was 32 when he switched from tottenham hotspur to arsenal in 1977 ; he played his last game for the club in 1985 at the age of 39 . there has never been a question over his worth and cech could be as important . cech is a better goalkeeper than liverpool stopper simon mignolet whom the reds paid # 9million for in 2013 pat jennings , pictured with liam brady , spent seven years at arsenal and played his final game aged 39
a gang enforcer convicted of beating and strangling a san antonio woman who refused to pay a mexican mafia-imposed tax on her illegal drug sales is set to be executed this week . the lethal injection of manuel vasquez on wednesday evening would leave texas prison officials in the nation 's most active death penalty state with enough pentobarbital to carry out only one more execution until they are able to obtain a new supply . at least six executions are scheduled in the coming weeks in texas , where prison officials -- like in other death penalty states -- have struggled to find providers for drugs for executions . vasquez , 46 , had no appeals in the courts tuesday and the texas board of pardons and paroles rejected a clemency petition filed on his behalf in a 7-0 vote . gang enforcer manuel vasquez , 46 , is scheduled for execution on wednesday for the ordered murder of a san antonio woman who ignored a 10 per cent street tax on drugs known as a ` dime ' evidence at vasquez 's 1999 capital murder trial showed he and two other men were carrying out orders to kill 51-year-old juanita ybarra for ignoring the mexican mafia 's 10 per cent street tax on drugs -- known as a ` dime . ' after a night of drinking and drugs at a run-down san antonio motel , vasquez and two companions barged into the nearby room of ybarra and her boyfriend , moses bazan , early on march 19 , 1998 , according to evidence presented at his trial . bazan was knocked out in an ensuing struggle but said he saw ybarra being beaten , heard vasquez holler that she was biting him and saw vasquez using a telephone cord to strangle ybarra . the attackers grabbed valuables like cameras and jewelry , stuffed them into a pillowcase and fled . when bazan regained consciousness , he stumbled to the motel office to summon police . he was able to identify at least one of the attackers , leading to the arrest of all three . one of them , johnny joe cruz , took a plea deal that carried a seven-year sentence and testified against vasquez . the third man charged , oligario lujan , is serving a 35-year prison term . court records show the three were carrying out orders from mexican mafia boss rene munoz , who spent years on the texas department of public safety 's 10 most wanted list until his arrest in 2012 . joel perez , vasquez 's lead trial lawyer , recalled last week that the motive for the slaying was ` very detrimental ' . ` we have the texas mexican mafia , and anyone selling drugs they collect a dime - 10 percent , ' he said . ` and the motive in this case was she was n't paying . ' the lethal injection of manuel vasquez on wednesday evening at huntsville prison in texas would leave t officials in the nation 's most active death penalty state with enough pentobarbital to carry out only one more execution until they are able to obtain a new supply detectives also found the blood of the victims and vasquez 's blood on clothing left in the trunk of a car he used . ` it put him at the scene when he denied being around there , ' mary green , an assistant bexar county district attorney who prosecuted vasquez , said . ' i recall he was an extremely violent individual . in the punishment phase we proved up two other homicides he 'd been involved with . ' vasquez had a lengthy record and had been in and out of prison at least twice . one conviction involved the beating of a man who died after his body was set on fire . records also show vasquez ' father is serving a life sentence for a 1976 murder , and a brother and cousins are or have been in prison .

' he added that many elderly people would have difficulties with the new system . birmingham lawyer dean parnell , who had to track down and recover his stolen ipad in 2013 because officers were too busy to attend , said ` a faceless online service ... could lead to important evidence being missed ' . the force also wants to encourage witnesses to supply images or video footage of incidents such as street thefts or assaults . its new operating model will see neighbourhood officers deployed into specific areas , instead of across the force patch , leaving middle class areas where crime is less of an issue without a significant uniform presence . the force said the changes were needed as part of cuts aimed at saving # 130million over the next four years . chief constable chris sims admitted that officers would ` not be as visible on the streets ' in future , as the force looked to achieve ` greater efficiency ' . west midlands police have unveiled a five year blueprint for ` virtual policing ' plans . pictured : west midlands police headquarters beat bobbies will be cut or reassigned , with the ten neighbourhood policing units replaced by smaller teams targeting areas where a police presence is most needed . the plans will see the birmingham-based constabulary shrink to its smallest size since it was established in 1974 . the force wants to encourage online reporting of all but the most serious offences . david jamieson , west midlands police and crime commissioner , said : ` we hope that by the end of this year you will be able to log in and watch the progress of an investigation in the same way that you can track a parcel .

' in december , peta founder ingrid newkirk said : ` peta is sure that britain , australia and the u.s. are not exempt from the dog leather trade . ` many british high-street retailers are importing cheap leather from china , so products made from dog skin are almost certainly on the shelves and in people 's wardrobes . ` skin looks the same , whoever it comes from , and chinese dog killers are not likely to advertise their skins honestly , so it 's impossible to tell if those leather gloves or wallets are made out of dog , cow , pig , or goat skin . ` peta is calling on british shoppers to consider the terror that dogs and other animals endure when they 're mercilessly slaughtered and make the safe , vegan choice in clothing and accessories for the holidays and every day .

( cnn ) pablo picasso once asked : " are we to paint what 's on the face , what 's inside the face or what 's behind it ? " jessica todd harper 's photo book " the home stage " does all three simultaneously . " the home stage " contains intimate , psychological portraits that harper has created of herself , her family and friends , and their children . the book weaves in some photos of other people 's families as well , and includes writing by alain de botton and alison nordstrom . using her camera like a paintbrush to stroke the canvas that is her environment , harper explores the experiences of parenting and childhood . as a mother to twin sons and a daughter , her photos contain a wide range of raw emotion , ranging from comfort and conflict to sleepiness and satisfaction . harper 's first photo book , " interior exposure , " focused on the early years of her marriage and adult family life . she says her latest book is like a natural segue , as " the home stage " includes many photos of children . the title -- " the home stage " -- has more than one particular meaning or reference . " one is to convey that stage in life when you 're anchored to the home with young children , " harper said . " it also references how the home is the first stage in which children learn how to live in every situation . in my particular pictures , many of them have a stage-like quality . there 's reference to tableau vivant of the past , these constructed images . " harper 's mother was a big fan of the arts , and she would take young harper and her sister to local art museums where they would copy paintings by hand , progressing from crayons to charcoal and , eventually , to pastels . " i wanted to be just like mary cassatt and john singer sargent ; those were the artists that i would copy a lot as a child , " she said . " i think those images got very much stuck into my deep psyche . " she emphasizes that her photos are not the everyday snapshots that many parents post on facebook -- the photos of children at various stages in their lives , attending birthday parties or riding tricycles . the book 's pictures " are n't documents , " harper said . " they 're making everyday moments have an eternal quality . it reminds us of our more general purpose in life , the meaning in everyday small things . " the combination of harper 's color palette and the use of natural light fills every inch of her photos with rich detail . many of harper 's photos contain several generations of her family , highlighting connections between the present , past and future . while the people harper photographs are predominantly those most familiar with her , she makes an effort to not allow her camera to completely consume the lives of her subjects . " i try to do a very good job of not being overbearing . ... i bring out the camera only when i have a very specific idea in mind . my children know that i 'm an artist , i 'm a photographer . they know that , but i do n't think that they see that even in the top 10 of the ways that they relate to me , it 's not as subjects , " she said . " i want to keep it that way because otherwise they become so self-conscious and they start doing things which are not natural or genuine . " each photo draws the curtain to reveal harper 's home stage -- harper lying in bed with her son marshall , her husband playing in the backyard with their children , her daughter sitting in a high chair . follow @cnnphotos on twitter to join the conversation about photography . regardless of the subject matter of the photos , harper says there is one thing that ties all of them together : light . throughout " the home stage , " harper also manages to effectively create a balance between carefully planned compositions and naturally occurring moments . while harper recognizes that raising young children can be intense and tiresome , she emphasizes it is vital to take the initiative to create memories -- not simply wait to capture certain moments . this is evident with the self-portrait she made holding her son nicholas , stopping her family in the midst of their dinner preparations . " at the time , i felt like so many parents . i felt tired and distracted and busy trying to get things done . i felt a little bit of guilt about making this picture , " harper said . " and yet i knew somewhere in the back of my head that there was an imperative that i must take moments . ... you 're just so busy that if you do n't purposefully force it , then it would n't happen . " in one photo , viewers are witnesses to an intimate familial relationship as they simply see a mother as she lays her hand gently on her son 's back . " it 's a universal mother-and-child gesture , " harper said . " it does n't even matter particularly who that individual mother or that individual child is because of the way they 're framed and photographed . you ca n't see their faces . it 's just the way that her hand is resting on his back . it 's ownership and protection and love . " jessica todd harper is an american photographer based in philadelphia . her book " the home stage " is available on amazon , and the photos are on display at the print center in philadelphia until march 28 .

after months of defending marvin gaye 's work , the late motown singer 's family breathed a sigh of relief in court on tuesday as a jury decided that the robin thicke song ` blurred lines ' ripped off gaye 's 1977 hit ` got to give it up ' . following the decision , gaye 's ex-wife and children sat down for interviews to describe the emotional legal battle to stand up for his music and how they hold no ill-feelings towards the song 's producer , pharrell williams . ` it 's gratifying , i just felt filled , ' ex-wife janis gaye told abc news . winners : marvin gaye 's family say they are relieved by a court ruling , declaring the song ` blurred lines ' infringes on the late motown singer 's work . from left to right : marvin gaye 's son marvin gaye iii , daughter nona gaye , and ex-wife janis gaye overcome with emotion : tears welled in nona gaye 's eyes as she reflected on the multi-million dollar lawsuit the success of the family 's lawsuit in court is also sparking discussion online as to whether some of pharrell 's other work infringed on gaye , with many drawing comparisons between his 2013 hit ` happy ' and gaye 's ` ai n't that peculiar ' . ` i 'm not going to lie . i do think they sound alike , ' gaye 's 40-year-old daughter nona told entertainment tonight . while the family hears the similarities , they say they are not interested in going back to court anytime soon . ` we 're not in that space , ' nona added . furthermore , the gayes are open to mending ties with pharrell , and said they would be willing to include him in a tribute show to the late r&b star . in court on tuesday , nona gaye cried in court as a jury decided to award her family $ 4million in damages and $ 3.4 million in profits from the song . thicke will be forced to pay $ 1.7 million from his own pocket and pharrell $ 1.6 million . got to give it up : robin thicke ( left ) and pharrell williams ( right ) are seen leaving court last week during the trial . they were not present when the decision was read on thursday ' i feel free , free from ... pharrell williams ' & robin thicke 's chains , ' said nona gaye in an emotional statement outside the courtroom following the verdict on tuesday the verdict could tarnish the legacy of williams , a reliable hit-maker who has won grammy awards and appears on nbc 's music competition show the voice . it was previously revealed that the song had made a staggering $ 16million for pharrell , thicke , rapper t.i. and the record company , though t.i. and various record and music companies had previously been cleared of copyright infringement charges . an attorney for thicke and pharrell has said a decision in favor of gaye 's heirs could have a chilling effect on musicians who try to emulate an era or another artist 's sound . all three later released a statement , saying ; ` while we respect the judicial process , we are extremely disappointed in the ruling made today , which sets a horrible precedent for music and creativity going forward . ` blurred lines ' was created from the heart and minds of pharrell , robin and t.i. and not taken from anyone or anywhere else . we are reviewing the decision , considering our options and you will hear more from us soon about this matter . ' ` right now , i feel free , ' an emotional nona said after the verdict . ` free from ... pharrell williams and robin thicke 's chains and what they tried to keep on us and the lies that were told . ' tragic death : gaye , best known for such classics as sexual healing , i heard it through the grapevine and how sweet it is ( to be loved by you ) , was tragically murdered by his father when he was just 44-years-old this was no doubt in response to the fact that pharrell and thicke had filed a lawsuit against gaye 's estate back in august 2013 in an attempt to stop his family from suing them for copyright infringement . ` plaintiffs , who have the utmost respect for and admiration of marvin gaye , funkadelic and their musical legacies , reluctantly file this action in the face of multiple adverse claims from alleged successors in interest to those artists . defendants continue to insist that plaintiffs ' massively successful composition , ` blurred lines , ' copies ` their ' compositions , ' read the suit . this suit however was thrown out in october of that year , when a judge ruled that the family had made a sufficient showing that the two songs were similar . ` we did not start this fight ... pharrell williams and robin thicke started this lawsuit , " busch said outside of the courthouse . ` we fought this fight with one arm tied behind our back . ' victory speech : nona gaye ( second from left ) , daughter of late singer marvin gaye , and her lawyer richard busch ( front right ) speak to the media following the verdict on tuesday the gayes ' lawyer branded pharrell and thicke liars who went beyond trying to emulate the sound of gaye 's late-1970s music and copied the r&b legend 's hit got to give it up outright . he also brought up the fact after the verdict that the defense 's legal team did everything they could to stop the jury from hearing gaye 's song during the proceedings , allowing them to just listen to certain snippets of the music . for this reason the infringement charge only applied to the sheet music for the two songs , making the case against thicke and pharrell that much more difficult for the gaye family . busch however pointed out during his argument that thicke said in interviews while promoting the single that he and pharrell were trying to write something like gaye 's got to give it up . thicke told jurors he did n't write blurred lines , which pharrell testified he crafted in about an hour in mid-2012 , as he was too high on painkillers and alcohol . ` the biggest hit of my career was written by somebody else , and i was jealous and wanted credit , ' said thicke . he also took time on the stand to play a variety of songs that sound similar in music and tone in an attempt to strengthen his case pharrell told jurors that gaye 's music was part of the soundtrack of his youth , but the seven-time grammy winner said he did n't use any of it to create blurred lines and that the songs were alike in genre only . the pair 's lawyer maintained their innocence even after the verdict , saying ; ` they 're unwavering in their absolute conviction that they wrote this song independently . ' heads held high : busch , far left , walks with the late singer , marvin gaye 's family members , from left , daughter , nona , ex-wife , jan , and son , frankie , on tuesday according to the los angeles times , he song brought in $ 5.6 million for thicke , $ 5.2 million for pharrell and another $ 5 million to $ 6 million for the record company , as well as an additional $ 8 million in publishing revenue gaye 's children - nona , frankie and marvin gaye iii - sued the singers in 2013 and were present when the verdict was read . the family had initially asked for $ 40million in damages , but later lowered that number to $ 25million . this was based on the amount of money they believed gaye would have been paid had he signed off on the rights to his song . gaye 's ex-wife janis testified that as soon as she heard the song she recognized the similarities and was thrilled thinking that this would introduce the music of her late husband to a new generation of music lovers . that quickly turned to anger however when she learned the rights to gaye 's song had not been licensed . sales of the 2013 song , which has already sold 7.3 million copies in the united states alone , are still going strong too , and have seen a drastic increase over the course of the trial this past few weeks . gaye , best known for such classics as sexual healing , i heard it through the grapevine and how sweet it is ( to be loved by you ) , was tragically murdered by his father as he tried to break up a fight between his parents and protect his mother in 1984 . the singer , just 44-years-old at the time , had been nominated for 14 grammys at that point over the course of his brilliant but all too brief career , and left the rights to all his music to his three children . an appeal of the ruling is already being considered by pharrell and thicke 's lawyer . tom petty vs. sam smith : smith 's monster hit stay with me , a song which earned him three grammys at this year 's ceremony while also contributing to his best new artist victory , sounded a little to similar to the petty classic i wo n't back down , something the latter 's lawyers picked up on and took to court . the two settled the entire thing like gentlemen however , coming to an agreement out of court that gives petty and composer jeff lynne a writing credit on the track and 12.5 % of the royalties . the rolling stones vs. the verve : the verve became one of the biggest bands of 1999 thanks to their hit bittersweet symphony , a song which sampled strings from the rolling stone 's the last time . the band however was told they could only use a five-note sample , and once they song was released were accused of breaking their promise and using more . as a result , mick jagger and keith richards were given writing credits for the track alongside the verve 's richard ashcroft , and the group had to relinquish all royalties they received for the song . queen and david bowie vs. vanilla ice : while vanilla ice remains a one-hit wonder , that hit , ice ice baby , still receives massive play over 20 years after it was released by the rapper . the song clearly borrowed however from the david bowie and queen tune under pressure , something the rapper initially denied . the case was eventually settled out of court , and the details of the settlement were never revealed , though it is known that freddie mercury , brian may , roger taylor , john deacon and bowie all now have songwriting credits . bright tunes vs. george harrison : in the biggest copyright infringement case prior to tuesday 's ruling , harrison was accused of using the ronnie mack song he 's so fine in creating his solo song my sweet lord . the case dragged on for five years , ultimately making its way to a united states federal court , where harrison lost and was forced to pay $ 1,599,987 , a staggering amount at the time . isley brothers vs. michael bolton : bolton used elements of the isley brothers song love is a wonderful thing in his song of the same name , and as a result ended up having to pay $ 5.4 million , when the case went to court , which before tuesday was the largest amount ever awarded in a copyright infringement case .
world champion lewis hamilton is amused by red bull 's complaints about mercedes ongoing dominance , accusing the sport 's preceding power of double standards . mercedes are expected to dominate this weekend 's malaysian grand prix , just as it did at the season opener in australia with a one-two finish , and the entire 2014 season . the huge edge mercedes enjoys prompted calls for rule changes to make f1 racing closer , and after the melbourne procession , red bull even floated the idea of withdrawing from the sport if the situation does not improve . lewis hamilton has accused red bull of double standards after their threat to leave formula 1 the mercedes driver romped to victory at the australian grand prix with nico rosberg in second sebastian vettel and red bull were hugely successful before mercedes ' improvement in the last two years ' i genuinely find it quite funny , ' hamilton said thursday , noting that red bull saw no problem with the sport when it was dominating and sebastian vettel won four straight championships . ` it 's an interesting opinion coming from individuals who had so much success . to already have comment after one race i find quite funny , ' he said . hamilton said mercedes had simply done a better job than its rivals , who need to work harder to catch up rather than seek to change the rules . ` not once did this team ever complain to others to equalise things , ' hamilton said . ` now we are the best team , we pulled together and did an amazing job . ' hamilton walks in the paddock ahead of this weekend 's malaysian grnad prix red bull 's australian driver daniel ricciardo chats to team principal christian horner in kuala lumpur the re-introduction of mid-season engine upgrades this year does promise closer racing late in the year , but in the meantime mercedes is expected to remain in a class of its own at the front of the field in malaysia and beyond . however hamilton was wary of ferrari 's performance during race-pace long runs in melbourne , and saw the italian team as the main threat . ` definitely ferrari have made a huge step and that is good to see , ' hamilton said . ` they put in some really spectacular sectors in the last race weekend . ' mercedes had cheekily invited vettel to its friday engineering briefing at sepang after the german accepted an offer from mercedes ' nico rosberg made during the post-race media conference in australia . however , mercedes had since broadened the offer to any rival team to attend , and ferrari said neither the team nor vettel would be taking up the offer . hamilton takes a selfie during a fan event in kuala lumpar , malaysia on wednesday hamilton says ferrari will be close challengers this year and admits he has been impressed with their pace

look out for barbary apes , grins our guide : ` we often get raided , especially in the harvest . ' ahmad , aged 72 , finds most things funny . he owns a donkey called ` easyjet ' and tells us that most of his neighbours will live to 105 . our week in the rif , a mountainous region of northern morocco , follows this pattern - it is full of surprises . the tops of the mountains are dusted with snow , and yet , around the bottom , you can buy oranges as big as a baby 's head . a rif you 'll want to hear forever : the rif mountains are a beautiful - yet less known - part of morocco on ahmad 's country walks we see mountain women wearing wide-brimmed hats festooned with pom-poms . one minute we 're clambering through gorgeous terraces of onions and fruit , the next we 're in a paddock of cannabis ( or kif ) . ` just for the farmers , ' says ahmad airily . ` the long-haired ones do n't come any more . ' but strangest of all is our first town , chefchaouen . the old parts are all a bluey-purple , as if the entire medina has been flushed with ink . to my daughter lucy , aged ten , this is enchanting , and we tour every alley and knobbly passage , poking our heads into all the old caravanserais . there are no cars in this beautiful labyrinth of mauve , and in the mornings everyone rushes out to the public taps . we stay at the lina ryad , a little bit of the 21st century dropped in among these dreamy scenes . it even has a modest swimming pool , in a town where most people think a traffic jam has hooves . this is not a place for ordinary shopping . we somehow end up with an old pair of slave 's manacles ( # 7 ) , a large flag ( # 6 ) and a very battered silver headdress ( # 30 ) . most of the time it is enough just to wander . from the kasbah ( or citadel ) we can peer down into people 's lives . as the day warms , housewives head out to the stream to rinse out their carpets . after a few days , we head north . country and city : a woman from the rif region in traditional dress ( left ) ; the back streets of tangier ( right ) the rif may not be morocco 's tallest range , but it 's thrillingly wild . great rivers burst through the boulders , and we can just make out tiny villages perched high up in the valley walls . then , suddenly , we tumble out into tangier . this fabulous antique city feels only half-african . for a long time , it was ` the international zone ' ( 1923-1956 ) , and europeans appeared in droves . they left cafes , cannon , art deco , a long corniche and a whole cemetery of kind hearts and baronets . some came for the view , and we tour the celebrity roosts . there 's still a piano bar at the el-minzah ( churchill and rex harrison ) , although the hotel cecil ( tennessee williams ) now has palm trees growing through the roof . meanwhile , at grand hotel villa de france , you can visit matisse 's bedroom ( number 35 ) and gaze out at the scenes he painted . others came to misbehave , particularly the beat poets . it 's fun trying to find their old haunts around the medina . although dean 's bar was wreathed in dust and padlocks , you can still get a whiff of the fifties at cafe baba . however , for lucy , the best moments are when we head for the souk . one stall sells huge blocks of nougat ( which have to be chopped with a cleaver ) ; another has only magic charms and musket balls . captivating : tangier - with its medina to the forefront - has long tempted european travellers to morocco deep in the medina , little alleyways turn into grand arabian palaces ( like al-makhzen ) , or perhaps the house of barbara hutton , once the richest woman in the world . my favourite is the old american legation of 1821 . from the outside , it looks typically dusty and medieval , but step inside and a glorious georgian residence appears . such excitement requires a cosy bolthole , and we have la tangerina . hidden in the ramparts , this tiny hotel has been lovingly restored . there are log fires and almond cake for tea , and time seems to have paused at 1956 . enjoy this mad city , walk everywhere , do everything and then retreat to the hotel 's roof . in one direction lies spain ( only eight miles away , across the med ) and in the other lies the rif , now looking pink and mysterious and deceptively tame . audley travel ( 01993 838 420 , www.audleytravel.com ) offers a ten-night private tour of fes , chefchaouen , tangier , rabat , asilah and casablanca , from # 1,850 per person ( two sharing ) including flights . john gimlette is the winner of the dolman travel book prize 2012 , with wild coast : travels on south america 's untamed edge ( profile # 8.99 ) .
the weekly shop has become something of a modern day nightmare with stores asking us to either scan as we shop or use self-service tills . but now one of britain 's biggest supermarkets has turned its back on technology in favour of human staff manning stores . morrisons 's new ceo , david potts , who took over last week has scrapped the intelligent queue management ( iqm ) system used in shops after receiving feedback from customers and staff . morrisons has ditched its intelligent queue management system in favour of returning to using humans to decide how many checkouts to open in stores the technology , which was introduced in 2008 , used infrared sensors to determine how many checkouts to open by monitoring the number of customer flowing through the store . it meant that during quieter periods staff could be taken off the tills and placed in other parts of the store . the company 's retail team , along with the new boss , concluded that checkout teams would make better and more balanced decisions compared to the iqm computer system . but while they have brought humans back to monitor queues , the controversial self-scan tills will be here to stay . ex-tesco executive mr potts , who took over as morrisons ' chief executive on march 16 , spoke with customers and staff and after feedback decided to scrap some of the modern day technologies morrisons was the only british retailer to use iqm , which used infrared sensors both at the entrance to the store and over each checkout lanes . it was supposed to enable checkout managers to predict exactly when shoppers would arrive at the checkouts so the tills were open for them when they got there . when the iqm system was first rolled out as part of a trial with the promise of cutting customer waiting times it had a five per cent success rate , however , staff claimed the system was pointless . some took to online job review website glassdoor to complain , with a department manager in felixstowe , suffolk , describing it as ' a waste of time and money ' . the unnamed manager had added : ` it [ the iqm ] messes up all the departments in the store and it has a major knock on effect to all other departments with the waste and markdown and rotation . ' a checkout operator from portsmouth , writing in october last year , said : ` morrisons needs to go back to basics . we are a superior supermarket and that 's what we need to install in customers old and new . ` customers want to be treated . show them we care more than the other leading stores . ' after listening to colleagues executives have also decided to scrap another computerised system which measures the amount of products scanned every minute by checkout staff . the ` scan rate ' was introduced in 2012 after imposing new time targets of one item every three seconds , which prompted an outcry from members of the public , who branded the supermarket as turning into a ` battery hen farm ' . mr potts , a former executive at tesco , said : ` we intend to be an organisation that listens very hard to its customers and staff and , wherever possible , responds quickly . ` our colleagues in our stores are best placed to use their experience and personal judgement in deciding how best to serve their customers , keeping queues low at the checkouts and improving the customer 's shopping trip .

it was a weekend when andy murray was full to bursting with emotion , but he struck a note of pragmatism after leading great britain to davis cup victory . the din of what is the closest he can get to a home-town crowd was still ringing in his ears as he considered the implications of a 3-2 victory over america - one that has again put leon smith 's squad into the last eight of the sport 's premier team competition . wimbledon 's host nation may not be able to raise a quorum when it comes to volume of players in the world 's top 100 , but where there is murray , there is hope . andy murray celebrates as his win over john isner leads great britain into the davis cup 's last eight murray celebrates during his straight sets win over isner that clinched the brits a quarter-final place murray produced the right results in points at key moments to overcome the fancied american he showed that again as he held off a ferocious challenge from 6ft 10in john isner to win 7-6 , 6-3 , 7-6 and push britain into a july quarter-final against france . yet he was cautious about whether that could actually lead to gb winning the davis cup for the first time since 1936 . ` to win the event is an extremely difficult thing to do , ' he said . ` even with someone like federer , such a great player , it 's taken him to have a top five in the world partner ( stan wawrinka ) to help him to do that . we 're playing at the limits of our level right now . ' if he was merely being realistic there was not , after all , a great deal of time for heady celebration . such are the demands of the tour that he was flying back to london on sunday night and then flying on monday morning to los angeles for the season 's first masters level event at indian wells . accompanying him will be james ward , without whom none of this weekend 's triumph would have been possible . murray was the star but this was truly an anglo-scottish enterprise at a time when such things are under threat . james ward turned the tie in great britain 's favour with his own victory over isner on friday ward took the first two sets in the dead rubber against donald young but retired to protect his knee ward 's friday night epic against isner turned this match in the home side 's favour - just as he had 13 months ago in the corresponding first-round match against america , when he defeated sam querrey . the 28-year-old londoner is one of those players who grows an extra three inches in the team environment , but it is expecting a lot of a player outside the world 's top 100 to keep the upsets coming . ward even took the first set against donald young in the dead rubber after murray 's victory on sunday but then conceded the match to protect his sore knee . when asked about his side 's potential , smith said : ` we have still got a bit of work to do but we are getting closer . we can trouble most teams . you 've seen the spirit we have . ' the victorious great britain team smile with clenched fists after their 3-2 win over the united states the brits gather on the court after their win which sets up a clash with france in the quarter-finals this was another triumph for smith . in an era when big-name ex-players are all the rage as coaches , he continues to land blows for the lower-profile professional . for the second consecutive time he has got the better of former world no 1 jim courier in the captain 's chair . murray is not only among the planet 's best tennis players , he has also shown what a team man he is this weekend with his passionate support from the sidelines . if there is a worry , it is that it may all have sapped him . it helped that the 7,700 capacity crowd was intent on dragging him over the line . no wonder the debate over the next month will be whether the advantage of grass in the next round is outweighed by the passion of playing in scotland on a hard court . murray , embracing gb team captain leon smith , praised the ` effort and attitude of everyone in the team ' great britain captain smith celebrate as their talisman murray wins a crucial point against world no 20 isner murray said : ` i knew that james was extremely tired and i knew it would be a very tough ask for him to come out and win that match ( yesterday 's final singles ) after me . there is pressure to help your team-mates out and i wanted to try and finish the tie there . ` i was very emotional all weekend -- it is quite draining . i was proud of the team , the way they performed and fought in this arena under so much pressure . ' isner was desperate to make amends for friday and had come out swinging in the first set against murray , backing up his enormous serve with early strikes in rallies designed to prevent any long exchanges . he forced seven break points en route to the tiebreak including three set points at 5-4 , which saw him taking huge cuts at murray 's more vulnerable second serve . what it came down to was murray 's greater sangfroid in the tiebreak , which isner began with a double fault . that first set settled the nerves of murray and the crowd and he broke for 4-2 in the second with an exquisite lob -- no mean feat against a giraffe-like opponent . to isner 's credit , he kept fighting . but the second tiebreak followed much the same pattern as the first and was sealed 7-4 with a swinging ace which met with a cacophony that nearly blew the roof off . it was the kind of supreme effort from murray that is all too easily taken for granted . big american isner fell to murray after james ward come from two sets down to beat him in an epic tussle isner took responsibility for the loss saying ` this one 's on me ' after his loss to ward isner , however , says there were ew players in the world who could have conquered murray in glasgow
husband-and-wife meth users disarmed a colorado wildlife officer and a sheriff 's deputy then forced them to their knees along a desolate mountain highway before the husband was killed in a struggle , police reports released thursday show . the man had handcuffed the deputy and held both officers at gunpoint with their own weapons before the wildlife officer overpowered him , took back his gun and shot him to death monday near the small town of dinosaur in northwestern colorado , about 10 miles from the utah border . neither officer was injured during the encounter that began after they found the couple 's abandoned ford explorer on the side of the road . outlaws : georgie hand , 43 , faces charges of attempted first degree murder , second degree kidnapping , aggravated robbery among other charges . her husband , james damon , 46 , was shot and killed by police georgie hand , 43 , faces charges including attempted first-degree murder , kidnapping , aggravated robbery and disarming a peace officer . her husband , james damon , 46 , died at the scene . the police reports provide new details about the harrowing struggle . after finding the suv , wildlife officer nathan martinez followed a set of footsteps to the couple , who were sitting on a hillside . damon aimed a handgun at martinez and ordered him to keep his hands up as hand pulled the officer 's weapon from his holster , the reports state . they forced martinez to sit down and toss his radio onto the ground . damon asked if he had a wife and kids , finally saying , " how do we get out of this , how does everybody walk away alive ? " hand told investigators , according to the reports . pointing martinez 's own gun at him , the couple then led him down the hill toward moffat county deputy bhrent shock . struggle : a colorado sheriff 's deputy and a state wildlife officer were held hostage by a husband and wife before a struggle erupted and the man was fatally shot . hand told investigators her husband pointed his gun at shock 's face and ordered him to the ground , where damon stripped him of his gun , radio and stun gun before handcuffing his right hand to his duty belt . damon then pressed the gun into the back of the deputy 's head . martinez threw the keys to his vehicle toward damon and told the pair they could take it and go , according to the reports . hand walked away and martinez told investigators that damon ordered the officers to their knees near the ford . martinez could see the deputy 's handgun in one of damon 's hands and his own weapon in the other . ` at this point , officer martinez knew they were going to die , but he was n't going to die without a fight , ' the police report says . he ` made the decision to disarm damon and get his own handgun back . ' some details of the struggle were hazy . martinez told investigators he did n't remember at what point the gun fired , but that it malfunctioned before he was finally able to fire a shot into damon 's back . the officers then arrested hand , who was still holding a handgun . a judge on wednesday ordered hand to remain in jail without bond . court records do not list an attorney who could comment on the allegations against her . hand told investigators she and damon had been injecting meth at least once a day throughout the week , according to the reports . the pair were wanted in wasatch county , utah , on charges of burglary , theft and forgery , according to court records . they were accused of using a stolen credit card and checks to make thousands of dollars of purchases at a wal-mart and elsewhere in december . authorities in chaffee county , colorado , were seeking them on suspicion of stealing credit cards , ski equipment , electronics and other items from cars and pawning them . chaffee county authorities issued warrants for their arrests in february . shock and martinez have been placed on administrative leave , a standard practice after an officer-involved shooting . the district attorney 's critical incident response team was investigating .
kell brook is willing to break with convention and give amir khan the lion 's share of any payday in an effort to finally lure him into a blockbuster world title fight . brook has the bargaining chip of a world championship belt but so far that has proved ineffective in drawing the bolton welterweight into a fight that would attract huge british interest . sportsmail understands khan would pocket in the region of # 4 million if he met the 28-year-old at wembley on june 13 -- a date brook 's promoter , eddie hearn , has penciled in with the national stadium . ibf world welterweight champion kell brook poses at a press conference at montgomery theatre , sheffield amir khan hits devon alexander during their welterweight bout at the mgm grand garden arena last year khan chats to liverpool midfielder and fellow maxi nutrition ambassador jordan henderson in a promo brook has gone to claim he would be prepared to accept a smaller payday as ibf champion to make the fight . but despite sporadic positive feedback from the khan camp , who told hearn at a recent meeting in blackpool that the bout ` will happen one day ' , the trail has since gone cold . brook , who defends his title on march 28 against jo jo dan , said : ' i think he is avoiding me like the plague . he said that i 'm an easy fight but how long have we been banging on about wanting the fight with him ? ` after i 'm done with amir khan he will just be a mere memory . ` he wants to fight some of these kids who have been super-featherweights . i am a genuine big welterweight who can seek and destroy him . ' hearn added : ` we want the fight so badly . we do n't believe we should take anything less than 50-50 but until we talk maybe we do . kell has not been in a mega-fight and has masses of monster paydays in front of him . if he has to give amir a little something to knock him out he probably will . ' khan 's fight in sheffield on march 28 will be his first since the horrific stabbing incident in tenerife last september that could have cost his life . at the very least it has meant a major delay in brook defending his world title for the first time . he intends on three more fights this year , though he believes he has a greater chance of attracting the winner of floyd mayweather 's showdown with manny pacquiao than he does of landing a khan bout that would draw enormous domestic interest . brook hits the bag during a media workout session at bary 's gym in las vegas in august 2014 brook lands a punch on shawn porter on his way to becoming world champion in august 2014 khan 's apparent interest in fighting america 's adrien broner would indicate that brook is low on his agenda , with brook saying : ' i think it is more likely i will end up fighting one of mayweather or pacquiao than khan , the way he is dragging his feet . a khan fight is so easy to make . all the signs are there for it to be an unbelievable fight . ' i have seen clips of him saying , ` win a world title ' , ` do this , do that ' . i have come through everything he has said and still nothing . ' i think people around him are blowing smoke up his **** and he is believing all the hype . do n't get me wrong he is a good fighter but i would take him out . ` we are ready to go with this fight . but i will fight anyone . i have only wanted to fight the very best . before i leave this fight i want to get in with the best . ' hearn told sportsmail earlier this week that discussions have started over a possible summer fight for brook against juan manuel marquez or brandon rios , who are both former world champions . adrian broner trades punches with john molina jr. during their match in las vegas earlier this year
kano , nigeria ( cnn ) troops from niger and chad discovered a mass grave with more than 90 decomposed bodies near a northern nigerian town recently retaken from the islamic militant group boko haram , security sources from both countries said friday . the corpses , some of them beheaded , were found in a shallow mass grave under a bridge just outside the nigerian town of damasak , near the border with niger , the sources said . troops from niger and chad took back the town from boko haram last week during a joint operation , the security sources said . damasak is in borno , one of several northern states inhabited by the islamist militant group . borno is in the northeast corner of nigeria and borders niger , chad and cameroon . boko haram has terrorized northern nigeria regularly since 2009 , attacking police , schools , churches , mosques and civilians . it has kidnapped students , including more than 200 schoolgirls who were abducted in april 2014 and remain missing . the group , its naming meaning " western education is forbidden , " has said its aim is to impose a stricter form of sharia law across nigeria . journalist aminu abubakar reported from kano , nigeria . cnn 's melissa gray wrote and reported from atlanta .

sportsmail takes a look at 10 things we have learned from an entertaining weekend of football including the fa cup , premier league and a daft red card . glen johnson still has plenty to offer liverpool as he waits to resolve his anfield future . the 54 times capped england right back is out of contract in the summer , and despite talk of a new three-year offer on reduced wages seems no closer to agreeing a new deal . in his first full game since collecting a groin injury against manchester united in december he was the team 's top passer against blackburn , finding a team mate with 82 of 87 passes -- half of them in the attacking half of the field . johnson 's role in defence also allowed emre can to play his more natural position at the base of the midfield . glen johnson still has a lot to offer liverpool as he tries to win a new deal at the merseyside club eric dier is starting to win his battle to establish himself as a centre half for tottenham after being forced to play at right back at the start of the season . the 20-year-old , who was born in cheltenham but grew up in portugal before moving to white hart lane from sporting lisbon for # 4million last summer , turned down an england under 21 call-up in the autumn because he did n't want to play at full back . he is improving rapidly now alongside jan vertonghen . at qpr he made 11 clearances , more than any other defender apart from the 14 managed by his belgian partner . eric dier ( right ) is beginning to establish himself as a top centre half after starring for tottenham nedum onuoha deserved credit for his determination to play for qpr against tottenham despite the horrific cut to his cheek he suffered a few days earlier in the defeat to arsenal . but the former manchester city defender showed signs that he was still suffering from the collision with team mate steven caulker . in the 90 minutes he gave the ball away 30 times as rangers , whose survival depends on their form at loftus road , slumped to their fourth home defeat in a row . nedum onuoha suffered this nasty facial injury in a clash of heads with steven caulker but opted to play on jonas olsson , key defender for west bromwich albion for the last few seasons , is now rapidly looking surplus to requirements . the 31-year-old swedish international had n't played since september after being axed by alan irvine before then needing surgery on an achilles injury . his comeback game at aston villa saw him dragged off after 68 minutes during which he struggled against the running of charles n'zogbia . jonas olsson 's days at west bromwich albion appear to be numbered after falling out of favour this season matt lowton has been one of the big winners at aston villa from the arrival of new boss tim sherwood . the 25-year-old had been out of favour under previous boss paul lambert who had picked him only four times all season , after bringing alan hutton in from the cold to play right back . but sherwood has trusted the former sheffield united defender to solve a problem at left back for him , and lowton has twice kept the involvement of west brom 's wide midfielder craig gardner to a minimum . matt lowton has been given a fresh chance by tim sherwood after being dropped by paul lambert pavel pogrebnyak remains an expensive legacy for reading from the days when former owner anton zingarevich persuaded his fellow russian to sign a # 65,000 a week contract . the striker was hugely unlucky not to find a winning goal for the royals in their 0-0 fa cup quarter-final at bradford , twice hitting the post . but that is symptomatic of the way his season has gone , with just four goals to show for 25 appearances . the bad news for boss steve clarke as he tries to balance his budget is that the pog , now aged 31 , still has another season of his bumper deal to run . pavel pogrebnyak has not lived up to his billing since joining reading in 2012 it 's little wonder that watford fought so hard to keep striker troy deeney away from both west brom and swansea in the january transfer window . the 26-year-old was also the subject of a failed bid by leicester last summer , signing a new contract and being appointed club captain . he 'd already made vicarage road history as the first player in 50 years to get 20 goals in two consecutive seasons -- and after getting his 16th of this campaign to earn a point at wolves he 's well on course to pass that target for a third year . troy deeney celebrates after scoring his sides second goal away to championship rivals wolves steve morison still has the faith of leeds manager neil redfearn -- even though he reaches the unhappy landmark today of two years since he last scored a goal for the club . in fairness the 31-year-old former welsh international did spend all last season on loan at millwall where his goals and all-round team play helped the london side avoid relegation . he 's failed to find the net in 18 championship games for leeds so far this campaign , but redfearn insisted his work rate up front was a key factor in the 1-0 win at wigan which brought the club their fifth win in seven games . steve morison ( left ) has n't scored for two years but still has the backing off his manager neil redfearn daftest red card of the weekend went to notts county 's liam noble who got booked for dissent at swindon -- and then moaned so much to referee gavin ward about that decision that he got a second yellow . the 23-year-old former carlisle midfielder has now been sent off three times this season and even manager shaun derry admitted : " i ca n't back him . " at least noble issued a heartfelt apology to the club afterwards -- but the geordie born youngster clearly has some red mist issues to overcome . liam noble ( centre right ) was sent off the second time against swindon after being booked twice for dissent sheffield united manager nigel clough has long since consigned burton albion to his personal history book -- but his links with the club he took from part-time football into the league in 11 years in charge are still strong . and that is already helping new boss jimmy floyd-hasselbaink as he tries to mark his first spell of management in english football by achieving a promotion . clough last week loaned belgian under 21 midfielder florent cuvelier to the brewers -- and the former stoke youngster marked his debut by coming off the bench to get the winning goal at hartlepool which kept burton top of league two . sheffield united boss nigel clough still has links with former club burton and loaned them florent cuvelier
anna marczuk-franczak , pictured after her arrest , has been jailed for wounding a man by stabbing him at a party in nelson , lancashire last year a polish woman repeatedly jailed for violence in her home country stabbed and nearly killed a man after moving to britain unimpeded , a court has heard . anna marczuk-franczak , 39 , served at least three prison stretches in poland for a series of attacks dating back to 2002 . but after being released from her most recent sentence in eastern europe , she moved to britain and attacked a man with a 30-inch kitchen knife in nelson , lancashire . a judge in preston has now jailed marczuk-franczak for two years for the stabbing , whose victim suffered a 10cm-deep wound to his chest . the crown court heard marczuk-franczak had invited piotr kolodziejski and his girlfriend , magdalena swistowksa , to her home in nelson to celebrate the feast of st anna last july . but the celebration quickly sour as marczuk-franczak became ` melancholy ' , complaining that her husband was still in poland and a current boyfriend was also away , the court heard . after a row broke out , marczuk-franczak armed herself with a 30-inch kitchen knife and stabbed mr kolodziejski to the chest . the knife thrust 10cm downwards from his neck into his chest cavity narrowly missing his vital organs . mr kolodziejski was rushed to hospital and was saved by doctors , being left with a 12-inch scar . marczuk-franczak later told police kolodziejski had started hitting his partner after a few drinks and she had intervened . she claimed that she had only picked up the knife to defend herself but admitted she had been ` waving it around ' . she said she later saw blood on the knife but does not know what happened to it . the knife was never recovered . mr kolodziejski said in a statement that the attack had a ` significant impact ' upon him . he said he struggles to zip up his clothing and shave . he also has problems sleeping and has become ` anxious and stressed , paranoid that someone may lunge at him ' , the court heard . the court heard that marczuk-franczak has served at least three prison sentences for violence in poland . the court heard marczuk-franczak had served three prison sentences for violence in her native poland in 2002 , she was convicted of theft and causing minor bodily injury and received a one-year prison sentence . the following year she was convicted of causing minor bodily injury and received 18 months in prison and got a further 18 months in may 2004 for the same charge . marczuk-franczak was jailed for two years this week after she was found guilty of wounding mr kolodziejski . passing sentence , judge andrew woolman said : ` this incident arose out of a dispute initially between the victim and his girlfriend , he was violent towards his girlfriend . ' i accept that he was violent towards you and he subjected you to a significant attack which caused extensive bruising to your body . i have seen the photos and i sentence you on the basis that it was the victim who caused the injuries to you . ` but the jury 's verdict means that you then picked up a kitchen knife and stabbed him in a downward motion to the neck quite deliberately . ` the knife went in some 10 cm down towards the chest cavity . fortunately for him and for you the knife did not touch any vital organs . ` nonetheless he is left with a serious wound partly caused by the knife and partly by the surgery and although he started the incident by attacking his girlfriend and you , it is clear that he is still , as a result of what you did to him , has significant problems both with his employment and his general life . ' the attack happened after marczuk-franczak invited the victim and his girlfriend to her home in elizabeth , street , nelson , lancashire the judge added : ` despite what he has done , you caused that dreadful injury . you are 39 years of age , you have lived in the uk for not too long . ` it 's clear that you have something of a turbulent life , you have convictions in poland for violence - there are not a lot of details but enough so i am able to conclude that you are no stranger to violence in the past when provoked , perhaps . ` your account in the trial was in affect , that the victim sustained his injuries by accident when you were waving the knife around - an account which the jury rejected . the injury you have caused is so serious that only an immediate custodial sentence can be justified . ' the home office investigates cases of eu citizens who commit crimes in britain before deciding whether to bring deportation proceedings . offenders who are given a sentence of 12 months or more are usually recommended for deportation . uk border controls are dependent on other countries sharing information about their citizens ' criminal pasts with them , a system which has led to many foreign criminals slipping into britain , including arnis zalkalns , the latvian killer believed to have murdered west london schoolgirl alice gross .

nick clegg last night issued a damning critique of the use of ancient laws to prosecute journalists pursuing public interest stories nick clegg last night issued a damning critique of the use of ancient laws to prosecute journalists pursuing public interest stories . the lib dem leader said prosecutors were ` relying on 13th century laws ' to put reporters on trial and condemned the lack of a defence for those ` uncovering information in the interests of the public ' . he is the most senior political figure to raise concerns about the multi-million pound police investigation into tabloid newspaper payments for information , which critics condemn as a ` witch hunt ' . operation elveden , which began in 2011 and has cost taxpayers more than # 15million , has seen dawn raids , large numbers of arrests and lengthy bail periods for suspects . but of the 20 journalists whose cases have come before the courts only two have been convicted , and last week one of those , a sun journalist , was invited to lodge an appeal against his conviction . the rejection of cases by a succession of juries has led to mps calling for the police and the cps to look again at the remaining cases . prosecutors have pursued the newspaper journalists and public sector workers using the ancient common law offence of misconduct in public office . but accused reporters have argued they are pursuing stories which were in the public interest . speaking at his party 's campaign launch in abingdon , oxford , mr clegg told the daily mail the public interest defence was ` just far too opaque in too many of our laws . he also called for a ` proper review and proper reform ' of the misconduct law . he said : ` i have long been concerned that the laws of the land are not clear enough on the public interest defence for journalists and other people who are covering information in the interests of the public . ' he added : ` it 's just far too opaque , in too many of our laws , exactly what is the strength and nature of a public interest defence . ` i would like to see that clarified in law , my party has always advocated that . he added : ` the fact that prosecutors are relying on 13th century laws , that we do n't have an up-to-date definition of what a public interest defence is , shows the need for a proper review and a proper reform of the law in this area .

( cnn ) as planets go , mercury does n't get a lot of love . people spend more time on google searching for queen singer freddy mercury than planet mercury ... and freddie 's been gone for nearly a quarter-century . not even nasa spends much time there , making it the least-explored inner planet in the solar system . but one question has long perplexed scientists : why 's the darned thing so dark ? compared with our own moon , which is about the same size , mercury reflects much less light . scientists at lawrence livermore national laboratory , brown university and the planetary sciences institute say they may have found the answer : it 's been " effectively painted black , " in the words of megan bruck syal , a postdoctoral researcher at lawrence livermore . over the eons , the researchers argue in a paper published monday in the journal nature geoscience , microscopic meteorites spawned from carbon-rich comets may have contributed enough dark-hued carbon to reduce the amount of reflected light . the pieces seem to fit together : there 's a lot more carbon dust thrown off from comets close to the sun , where mercury orbits -- about 50 times as much for mercury as for our moon , the researchers say . and tests using a big nasa gun made to simulate planetary impacts on a small scale seem to show the theory is plausible , the authors say . " we show that carbon acts like a stealth darkening agent , " said peter schultz , a professor emeritus of geological sciences at brown university . " from the standpoint of spectral analysis , it 's like an invisible paint . "

' ` they dealt with their sentence in the best possible way they could , ' nguyen says . ` the facts are there , they did help others . no one is making that up ; everything said about them is true . they were good guys and have helped endlessly . ' indonesia 's hard-line stance on the executions of chan and sukumaran have made nguyen fearful he and the other bali nine members wo n't be given a fair trial when it comes to the appeal . but while they are still alive , he says , ` we have hope . ' this week , lawyers for chan and sukumaran are pushing ahead with their last-ditch appeal against the administrative court 's decision to deny the pair an opportunity to challenge president joko widodo . the appeal has been adjourned until next week . the 31-year-old was convicted in 2005 for his involvement in a plot to smuggle 8kg of heroin out of bali of the mood in prison in indonesia at the moment , nguyen says malang is ' a different place . ' ` the people are different . they are really polite and respectful and are giving me the space i need right now , ' he says . ` but what 's happening affects me more , because i know those two [ chan and sukumaran ] while none of these people do , so life continues as normal for them . like nothing is happening . ' nguyen told the daily mail his family visit when they can , but that it 's far now and hard on them financially . asked what it 's like to see his family , he says : ` it is hard to answer this . ' ` i 'm happy seeing them , truly i am , but it 's also a reminder about the pain and problems i caused them .

' in prison , nguyen says he is trying his best not to lose hope , waking early each day to train and box at the gym and read . he is also teaching english to other prisoners and encouraging them ` to work through their problems at the gym . ' ` also what 's important for me is do is everything i can so people would never have to go through what we have by being involved in the drug trade , ' he says . ` but i must say , in all honesty , even though that 's what i want to do , nothing is certain in life . after more than ten years inside , nothing is the same . the world i knew once is n't the same .

from paul the psychic octopus to big head the sea turtle , the bookies are no stranger to calling in animals to help with working out the odds . now one is hoping a pack of corgis will give betting on the royal birth a boost , while giving the public a clue to the sex and name of the new fourth-in-line . the ` barkingham palace ' gold cup saw 10 dogs face off in race across london 's bedford square , with a pooch named alexandra taking first place . winning ways : corgi alexandra took the title in the barkingham palace gold cup five of the runners taking part in the race were male and five female , with each chosen by bookmakers ladbrokes because their names are among the most popular with punters betting on the new royal baby 's name . a dog called alexandra , a name that is currently running third in the betting , took the honours followed by camilla ( 100/1 ) and victoria ( 10/1 ) . among the boys , spencer came first , despite boasting real-life odds of just 25/1 , followed by james ( 8/1 ) and boris ( 200/1 ) . ` alexandra romped to victory and it looks like kate will soon be giving birth to a little girl next month , ' said ladbrokes ' jessica bridge , tongue firmly in cheek . prediction : the race was a tongue-in-cheek attempt to predict the name and sex of the new royal baby ready for action : the pets were put through their paces in a tiny parade ring beforehand the dogs emerge from the traps with spencer ( fourth from left ) taking an early lead sprinting ahead : the pets are on their way , although boris ( left ) does n't seem too bothered ` royal baby betting is booming and the arrival of a new heir to the throne is sure to see a record amount of wagers placed . ' alexandra , who won with a time of 4.32 seconds , was then treated to a winner 's ceremony that included a trophy and a rendition of the national anthem . although corgi elizabeth rolled home last in the barkingham palace gold cup , the name is currently the odds-on favourite should the duke and duchess of cambridge have a girl . other popular choices include charlotte , the second-favourite at 6/1 , and diana which comes in at 12/1 . streaking ahead : a sprinting alexandra leaves the competition trailing in her wake well ahead : alexandra charges down the final furlong followed by second-placed camilla good work : alexandra enjoys her trophy and a special rendition of the national anthem should the new royal baby prove to be a boy , it is james that is the hot favourite followed by arthur , henry , charles and thomas . while the majority of names put forward by punters are sensible , others have had a flutter on more outlandish names , according to bridge . ` elizabeth and james are currently the most popular girl and boy 's names , ' she explains . ` but that has n't stopped punters from betting on outsiders , including sapesan and mercedes at 500/1 apiece . ' less favoured names in the running include ruprecht , chardonnay , kevin and wayne , all at 500/1 , and ruth , justin and colin at 200/1 .
australian teenage jihadist jake bilardi was expressing anti-western sentiments years before he fled to the middle east australian teenage jihadist jake bilardi was expressing anti-western sentiments years before he fled to the middle east to fight with terror group islamic state . in comments posted about news stories and opinion pieces , bilardi pointed out the evils of australia and the united states . earlier this week , fairfax media revealed a ` jonathan edwards ' , who was thought to be a briton when he appeared in a photo brandishing a rifle between two bearded men in front of a black is flag last year , was in fact an 18-year-old from melbourne . bilardi is a high school drop-out who attended craigieburn secondary college - in the victorian capital 's north . a collection of his comments seen on the website , disqus , showed the teenager was an avid reader of al jazeera . they date back up to four years ago and most of them showed him weighing in on islamic issues . in response to another commenter , bilardi tells them to ` get a better education on the real teachings of islam ' before airing their opinion in may 2011 . ' i am not a muslim [ sic ] but you see i am not a pathetic loser who does n't know anything outside of their own home and i actually have a life i do n't just go on the internet to abuse people and their beliefs , ' the 18-year-old wrote . this came a year before the teenager , who has been dubbed the ` white jihadist ' , converted to islam and started worshipping at melbourne mosques , according to fairfax media . later in the year , bilardi hit out at an american who he accused of islamophobic behaviour . ` the cia funded al-qaeda , the us government funded the taliban . they brought this on themselves . you are a prime example of an islamophobe , ' bilardi said . ` saying " maybe if muslims did n't attack america " , you do realise that less than 1 % of muslims are terrorists and that islamic terrorism only makes up 6 % of global terrorism . ' bilardi added americans were being influenced by local media , saying the same happened to australians . ` if you 're smart enough and can think for yourself you can actually realise that most of the stuff you are told are lies , ' he said . earlier this week , a youthful islamic state fighter posing with a rifle was identified as melbourne teen jake bilardi jake bilardi 's aunt said the entire family was devastated by her 18-year-old nephew joining isis a craigieburn schoolmate was shocked because bilardi ` really kept to himself and did n't cause trouble ' ` america is supposed to be a land of freedom , but ... the cia can listen in on phone calls from anyone in the country , cameras have been set up on every street , people have been arrested just for being muslim , just shows what scum are running the country . ' the teenager was an avid reader of al jazeera and weighed in on islamic issues in the comments section bilardi also accused american soldiers of ` always killing innocent civilians ' in afghanistan and iraq , saying they were bombing and shooting them ` just for fun ' . ` they are sick twisted mental patients who do n't deserve to be allowed outside ever again , ' he wrote . ` then everyone gets angry when another boat full of asylum seekers comes into australian waters . ` they are not only fleeing the brutality of militias and the taliban , they are also fleeing the brutality of the western forces . ' these comment emerge as the family of bilardi reveal they are devastated by revelations he is now fighting with the islamic state terrorist organisation in iraq . speaking outside her melbourne home , bilardi 's aunt said they were struggling with the news the skinny 18-year-old had joined the terrorist organisation and had issued threats against his homeland . she was joined by former schoolmates , who are still in shock at the teenager 's transformation from awkward teenager to radical , gun-totting terrorist . ` how are we supposed to feel ? it is devastating , just devastating , ' bilardi 's aunt told daily mail australia . ` i mean , it 's my brother 's son , you are talking about . ' bilardi 's aunt said the family feels like they are being harassed as a result of her nephew 's radical move asked how the young man 's father was coping with the news and his auntie 's emotional response was : ` well , he 's not ' . ` we feel like we are being harassed because of this . it 's not about me , it 's my brother 's son . ' bilardi 's former schoolmates at craigieburn secondary college also described their shock at describing the awkward 's teen conversion to terrorism . a schoolmate , who asked not to be named , told daily mail australia : ` mate , i 'm shocked at what he 's done . ` no one at school saw this coming , we ca n't believe it , he was quiet , really kept to himself and did n't cause trouble there - our parents are upset too . ' in a series of tweets around christmas time , bilardi purportedly threatened more attacks following the martin place siege in this message , bilardi is referring to a call by an islamic state religious leaders to commit graphic crimes against americans , frenchmen or their allies , including australians neighbours too have been caught by surprise , with one admitting that ` i had no idea that sort of thing could happen , not here -- it 's terribly sad but i 'll keep my eyes open from now on , that 's for sure ' . the 18-year-old sent a series of sick tweets to federal police gloating about future terror attacks on australia . in one of the messages , bilardi threatened that the sydney lindt café siege was ` just the beginning for your dogs ' . bilardi described himself as a ` revert ' to islam who was ` tall , white , skinny , long hair ' in august , bilardi reported that he had arrived in the iraqi city of ramadi after ` making jihra ' ( or departing ) the tweets , which were first revealed by daily mail australia in december , also showed he was considering returning home to follow an islamic state leader 's order to kill disbelievers , including australians , by any means possible . ` that 's twice now i 've seriously considered coming back and following sheikh adnani 's fatwa in australia , ' he wrote . in october , al-adnani released an audio message where he implored his followers to commit graphic crimes against ` disbelieving american ( sic ) , frenchman or any of their allies . ` smash his head with a rock , or slaughter him with a knife , or run him over with your car , or throw him down from a high place , or choke him , or poison him , ' al-adnani said . and in another twitter message , reportedly written this week , he said he would another attack would ` make 9/11 look like child 's play .

a police mugshot of mukesh singh : one of four men convicted for the rape and murder of jyoti singh , he says women are ` far more responsible ' for rape a man who took part in the notorious gang rape and murder of a medical student in delhi blames her for the attack , saying ` you ca n't clap with one hand - it takes two . ' ' a decent girl wo n't roam around at 9 o'clock at night , ' said mukesh singh , one of four men condemned to death for the hideous sex attack that shocked the world two years ago . ' a girl is far more responsible for rape than a boy . boy and girl are not equal . housework and housekeeping is for girls , not roaming in discos and bars at night doing wrong things , wearing wrong clothes . ` about 20 per cent of girls are good . ' the depraved murder of jyoti singh in december 2012 sparked revulsion across the world as well as a wave of protests in india , where people demanded a change in attitudes towards women . the 23-year-old student had been returning from a cinema with a male friend on a sunday evening when she accepted a lift from the off-duty charter bus . once inside , bus driver mukesh singh , his brother ram , gym instructor vinay sharma , 20 , bus cleaner akshay thakur , 28 , fruit-seller pawan gupta , 19 , and an unnamed teenager subjected to a horrific rape . she died a fortnight later after suffering terrible injuries to her abdomen , genitals and intestines . jyoti 's death sparked a period of deep soul searching in india , where equal rights for women are enshrined in the constitution but rarely effective in practise . but even today , mukesh singh remains unrepentant . in an in-depth interview with filmmaker leslee udwin , as part of a documentary to be broadcast on bbc four , he blamed jyoti for daring to fight back against her attackers . ` when being raped , she should n't fight back . she should just be silent and allow the rape , ' he said . ` then they 'd have dropped her off after " doing her " , and only hit [ her friend ] the boy . ' his impending execution , he suggests , is a foolish move that will only endanger future rape victims . ` the death penalty will make things even more dangerous for girls , ' he said . ` now when they rape , they wo n't leave the girl like we did . ` before , they would rape and say , " leave her , she wo n't tell anyone . " now when they rape , especially the criminal types , they will just kill the girl . mukesh singh and his accomplices treated jyoti no better . after luring her aboard the bus , they took turns raping her and beat her with an iron rod when frantically tried to fight them off . two blood stained metal rods were later retrieved from the bus ; medical staff confirmed that ` it was penetration by this that caused massive damage to her genitals , uterus and intestines ' . and after the rapists had enough , rather than ` dropping her off ' they threw her and her friend from the moving bus . mukesh singh then allegedly tried to run them over , but her friend had enough strength left to pull jyoti out of the way . despite efforts to get her the best medical care , even flying her to a hospital in singapore , jyoti died 13 days later , having suffered brain damage , pneumonia , and abdominal infection . doctors had already been forced to remove most of her intestine . protest : jyoti 's death sparked outrage in india with many taking to the new delhi streets to demand better protection for women and a change in a culture which sees them as second-class citizens anger : protestors had given jyoti - whose name was at that point still barred from release - the name damini after a bollywood film of the same name where the protagonist fought for justice after a rape ordeal outrage : protestors hold candles in new delhi during a night vigil following the 23-year-old student 's gang-rape and murder . it was this outpouring that inspired the documentary about jyoti 's death for filmmaker ms udwin it was not the horror of the attack that compelled her to make her documentary , but the outpouring of anger in india at the social conditions that allowed it to happen . ` when news of this gang-rape hit our tv screens in december 2012 , i was as shocked and upset as we all are when faced with such brazen abandon of the norms of ` civilised ' society , ' she said . ` but what actually inspired me to commit to the harrowing and difficult journey of making this film was the optimism occasioned by the reports that followed the rape . ` courageous and impassioned ordinary men and women of india braved the december freeze to protest in unprecedented numbers , withstanding an onslaught of teargas shells , lathi charges and water canons , to make heard their cry of " enough is enough " . ` in this regard , india led the world by example . in my lifetime , i ca n't recall any other country standing up with such commitment and determination for women 's rights . ' mukesh singh , who denies raping jyoti but admitted driving the bus where she was attacked , and three others are currently awaiting the outcome of appeals against their convictions . his brother ram , widely considered leader of the group , was found dead in his cell in march 2013 . the fifth , juvenile perpetrator was also convicted of rape and murder and sentenced to three years in a reform facility . passing sentence on the gang in september 2013 , a judge condemned their ` exceptional depravity ' .

' a television crew from good morning britain , which filmed the moment they first met , asked the pair a few ` mr & mrs ' style questions before they boarded the plane . asked who would get the window seat miss wood offered it up to mr whitbread and whether they were thrill seekers or beach babes they agreed they were a bit of both . miss wood also revealed that she ` sleeps in the middle of the bed ' and the worst habit mr whitbread could have would be snoring , which he previously revealed he did . his new companion was then introduced to mr whitbread 's parents , who embraced her and their son . the pair flew to the caribbean region , where they stayed in the honeymoon suite in single beds , and returned on march 3 . this is the moment the pair first met live on breakfast television this morning . before then all they knew were each others names and what they looked like . mr whitbread said he wanted to save chatting for the plane explaining his decision to sell off part of his honeymoon to the highest bidder he said : ' i was gutted when she said she did n't want to get married but i realised i could n't mope forever and i did n't want what i 'd already paid to the holiday to go to waste . ` besides , i think it will be good for me to get away . i 'm just looking for a new friend who fancies a holiday with someone fun .

dentists are profiting from a huge rise in cosmetic treatment as more of us spend thousands of pounds to get a winning smile . the top-earning private dentists in the uk made a collective turnover of almost # 1billion in 2014 -- up 22 per cent on 2010 -- with treatments including ` smile analyses ' and sonic polishing , research shows . analysis by finance provider ldf says the rise is because britons are shelling out thousands of pounds for private treatment . one of the increasingly popular procedures is so-called smile analysis , when a dentist assesses the width of the mouth , its symmetry and the extent to which teeth are even and white . dentists are profiting from a huge rise in cosmetic treatment as more of us spend thousands of pounds to get a winning smile the process typically costs # 100 . but any subsequent treatment such as braces , crowns being fitted on uneven teeth or whitening can be up to # 10,000 depending on what a patient decided to have done . other procedures include sonic clean and polishing -- for about # 130 a session -- which uses air and tiny particles to blast teeth and remove stains caused by coffee , chocolate and wine . some private dentists have renamed their surgeries ` spas ' , greeting patients with scented candles in the waiting room and offering facials , foot massages and aromatherapy . separate figures from the british association of cosmetic dentistry estimate the number of people seeking such treatments is growing by 40 per cent a year . experts say adults are becoming more self-conscious and worry that their personal life and career may be hindered if they do n't have nice teeth . britons are shelling out thousands of pounds for private dental treatment also , medical advances have replaced traditional train-track braces with clear , barely noticeable devices costing # 6,000 . many are having these fitted in the run-up to major events where they will be extensively photographed such as family weddings or milestone birthdays . peter alderson , of ldf , said : ` british people have taken to cosmetic dentistry in a big way , and that 's reflected in rising incomes for top dentists . ` increasing numbers of dental patients are starting to explore cosmetic treatments like laser whitening , and are willing to pay significant amounts of money for cutting-edge services , especially if they are delivered in a more exclusive , private clinic-style environment . ` the biggest dental groups are able to invest very heavily in their practices ' equipment , furnishings and it systems , and that has raised the stakes in the profession markedly . the younger generation of dental clients -- those that are more comfortable with paying for cosmetic dentistry -- expects enhanced services such as online booking and text message reminders as well as cutting-edge treatments . ` if dentists want to make the most of the demand for cosmetic dentistry , they need the type of apparatus and environment that brings in clients , but that type of equipment routinely costs tens of thousands of pounds . ' one popular procedure is ` cosmetic bonding ' , in which grey fillings or chipped teeth are painted over to make them almost invisible , costing up to # 1,000 . laser whitening is increasingly being offered for about # 100 . nissit patel , of progressive dentistry in putney , south-west london , said : ` over the past five years , i have seen a huge increase in adult orthodontics , primarily for cosmetic reasons . in my practice , the business has at least doubled in the past three years . ' he added that many of his patients came to him shortly before weddings or birthdays .
the ponytail has gone , along with the modelling career and a shedload of money , but the ebullient darragh macanthony is not a man to look back and dwell . there has been a book too -- ` just about the football club , it was a bit daft ' -- not to mention an app ` to keep results up to date , but it was n't very good ' . meanwhile , owning peterborough has turned the league one club 's extrovert chairman into an anxious , superstitious obsessive -- ` my ocd is getting worse ' . peterborough chairman darragh macanthony has been in charge at the club since 2006 macanthony said he has no regrets about tweeting his disapproval of players macanthony , who flirted with modelling as a 17-year-old , shows he has no concerns in front of the camera suited in a verging-on-baggy pinstripe , macanthony strides into his minimalist office at the training ground , past the empty bookshelves , and admits he has never sat at his huge , empty desk before . it turns out that the decorators have been in since he last made the trip from his florida home . he likes it , especially the montage of family portraits which adorn the walls , even if they remind him how much he is missing wife natalie and their children : darcy , callum and cara , all under 10 . there is an internal door to the manager 's office , currently occupied by interim boss dave robertson following the reluctant severing of an eight-year on-off relationship with darren ferguson . ` so you thought i 'd be in a tracksuit ? ' he speaks in a soft irish brogue but the words are delivered at rat-a-tat speed in a contradictory combination of dictatorial charm . his style is to cut to the chase . the answer to his question is yes . based on the evidence of an 11-point twitter demolition of his players two months ago , the assumption is that macanthony is an owner who likes to meddle . ` i knew you 'd get to that , ' said macanthony , or @dmac102 . ` give me 11 reasons not to talk about twitter ! macanthony shows he is not shy in front of the camera as he pauses to take a selfie darren ferguson led peterborough to the championship after finishing second in league one in 2009 ` i have been caught saying things on twitter which i probably should n't have but my personality has always been honest and direct . i make mistakes , i am impulsive . ` what did the players think ? i did n't need to ask . i spoke to them on friday and joked " i 'm going to give you 11 great reasons on twitter why i 'm happy " ( five wins in six since ferguson 's departure ) . ` they know where i 'm coming from and i do n't think any of them could argue with my points . i understand it 's not the done thing , but i did n't buy a football club to live by the rules of the establishment . ` am i a frustrated football manager ? i am an owner and a frustrated fan . if you look for a manager who says i said " you must play so and so " , you wo n't find one . ' macanthony left ireland for spain with his family at 15 and by 29 had made a fortune from the property market , a large chunk of which went straight down the drain in the recession . the peterborough chairman and director of football barry fry celebrate after winning the jpt trophy in 2014 macanthony described getting relegated from the championship in 2013 as his worst moment at the club at 17 he flirted with modelling , influenced by his girlfriend at the time , and a fact gleaned as he comfortably poses for photographs . ` i had a ponytail , which my mum used to do for me . natalie does n't believe it when i tell her i used to be a model , but it was good money . ' another girlfriend tempted macanthony to london and college . he lasted two weeks before heading back to spain . buying a football club was a dream toy for the boy in 2006 and has remained a source of pain and pleasure ever since . ` i was 28-29 and at the top of my game , ' recalled macanthony , now 39 . ` then the recession came and the world nearly ended financially . it was tough , but the club kept me sane . ` it 's hard to name one best moment as there have been so many but the worst is easy . we were relegated from the championship on 54 points two years ago . ` we were 2-1 up ( against crystal palace ) with seven minutes to go and needed a draw . in the most horrific seven minutes in the history of the club they scored twice . crystal palace players celebrate kevin phillips ' goal as peterborough were relegated from the championship then manager ferguson consoles jack payne after peterborough threw away a late lead ` i was watching from home -- i have every game streamed to me . i 'm very tense in my chair , superstitious , and my ocd is over the top . you 're not going to make this article about my ocd are you ? i was never like this at the start and now it 's uncontrollable . ` everything has to be in the same place on my desk and pointing in a certain direction . no-one can talk to me during a game . one of the guys who worked for me walked in and we lost so now no-one is allowed to . ` when we were relegated i watched and reacted like a fan . then the financial implications come in . jesus , we have just lost # 6million worth of revenue . ' the logistics of living in the us mean that macanthony 's visits to the # 500,000 newly-refurbished training ground -- rented at # 1 a year from the school next door -- are regular rather than frequent . email and telephone have to do the rest of the time . there is a lot to cram in , including this interview . halfway through there is a knock on the door . ` i 'm busy , ' shouts macanthony as the door flies open regardless . ` i 'm doing an interview . ' the beaming face of director of football barry fry peers round the door . ` how you doing love ? we need him ( macanthony ) . peterborough director of football barry fry interrupts the interview to borrow macanthony during the interview macanthony has his picture taken after michael bostwick signs a new deal ` one minute , one photo . we 're signing a new player love , and there 's nothing more important than that . ' macanthony is as helpless as the rest at stopping the irrepressible fry and a short time-out is called , our photographer in hot pursuit . back at his desk , the chairman itemises the previous 24 hours , which involved meetings and the signing of six teenagers on pro contracts . the smile fades when the conversation turns to sir alex ferguson 's son darren , who managed peterborough twice under macanthony . it was like losing a member of the family . we spoke every day and we shared the highs and lows . it 's still quite raw . ` we have to get the next appointment right . the club has been stressing me this season , i have aged . but it 's enjoyable again . i 'm in the luxury position that the guys in situ are banging down the door . ' ferguson left the club for a second time in february - macanthony likened it losing a member of the family macanthony and fry pose together for a picture as the director of football gives the thumbs-up the new manager will be expected to recruit young , cheap players , produce a winning team and be prepared to lose them as the business plan is one big departure a year -- the club have generated # 30m of sales under macanthony . britt assombalonga was the # 5m cash cow last year , a record # 1m signing from watford sold on to nottingham forest , sparking another angry tweet from @dmac102 when forest missed a due payment . there could be new projects in the pipeline . a follow-up book to his first tome , from hobby to obsession , perhaps ? ` it was me and a dictaphone , ' revealed macanthony . ` and then i employed someone to write it . they wrote it badly from an english point of view . ` the fans liked it and it sold 10,000 but there was nothing about my personal life in there . i have n't written my autobiography yet -- now that would be an interesting book !

the family of private cheryl james , 18 , pictured , died from a single gunshot wound to the head at deepcut army barracks in surrey in 1995 a female soldier was subjected to sexual violence before her death at deepcut army base in november 1995 , it has been claimed . private cheryl james was one of four soldiers who died of gunshot wounds at the base between 1995 and 2002 . the 18-year-old recruit suffered a single gunshot wound to her head . an army investigation ruled that pte james took her own life , while a coroner returned an open verdict just three weeks after her death . now pte james ' family want a new inquest following the discovery of new evidence which could provide a different explanation for the tragedy . last july , the family were successful being granted a new inquest , but the hearing his being delayed by surrey police . the family 's legal team claim that new ballistics evidence as well as claims of bullying and sexual violence in the weeks leading up to pte james ' death . the 18-year-old from llangollen , denbigshire , north wales died on november 27 , 1995 . she suffered a single gunshot wound to the head , with the bullet entering between her right eye and the bridge of her nose . ballistics experts claim that it is highly unlikely that the bullet wound suffered by pte james could have been self inflicted . just five months before pte james ' death , private sean benton , 20 , from hastings , east sussex was discovered with five bullet wounds to his chest . the army maintained that pte benton took his own life in june 1995 , despite ballistics evidence suggesting that only one of the five rounds was discharged at close range . in september 2001 , private geoff gray , 17 , from east london suffered two gunshot wounds to the head while on guard duty . pte james was one of four young army recruits to have died at deepcut army barracks , pictured doreen and des james , pictured , want a new inquest to find out what happened to their daughter in 1995 on march 23 , 2002 , private james collison , also 17 , was found with a single gunshot wound to the chin . once again the army insisted that another young recruit had taken their own life . although the families of the dead soldiers believe that authorities are trying to cover up the real cause of the deaths . during the most recent hearing , alison foster qc told the high court : ` we will present shocking details which will pertain only to this girl . the 20-year-old of hastings , east sussex , was found dead at deepcut with five bullet wounds to his chest in june 1995 . despite ballistics tests suggesting only one bullet was fired from close range and the others from a distance , the army says he committed suicide . the 18-year-old of llangollen , denbighshire , was found with a single bullet wound to her head at the barracks in november 1995 . an army inquiry concluded she committed suicide while a coroner records an open verdict three weeks after her death . the young recruit ,17 , from hackney , east london , was found with two gunshot wounds to his head while on night guard duty in september 2001 . five shots had been fired and the other three bullets were not found . a coroner records an open verdict after hearing that a figure was seen running away from the area . the 17-year-old , from perth , was found dead with a single gunshot wound upwards through his chin while on night guard duty at the barracks in march 2002 . the army says he killed himself , but his parents do not accept this , insisting he had been happy . an inquest in february 2006 recorded an open verdict ` we will be looking at the circumstances surrounding cheryl 's death including ballistics , harassment and sexual violence towards her . ' pte james ' family want to have their daughter 's body exhumed for a new examination which they hope prove that the young recruit did not take her own life . the 20-year-long legal battle is being supported by liberty . pte james ' family are anxious that the new inquest into their daughter 's death is opened as quickly as is reasonably possible . but surrey police want the inquiry delayed as the families of the three other recruits may wish to reopen their inquests . pte james had been stationed at the controversial deepcut barracks near frimley in surrey for just 11 days at the time of her death as part of the royal logistics corps . she was found on november 27 , 1995 at 8.30 am near her guard post . the was armed with a standard-issue sa80 rifle . surrey police conducted their own investigation into the death which formed part of a 44-volume case file . it included statements , documents , notes , photographs and forensic evidence . liberty successfully managed to force surrey police , using the human rights act , to hand over the dossier , which is central to the latest legal bid . emma norton , legal officer for liberty , said : ` cheryl died in 1995 . surrey police held onto all the sensitive material about cheryl 's death , refusing to hand it over to the family until 2012 -- and then only under threat of litigation using the human rights act . ` the content of the disclosure is shocking and it was on the basis of that evidence that the high court ordered a fresh inquest . ` after almost 20 years her case is finally ready to proceed . ` that it should now be surrey police -- again -- that is standing in the way of the investigation by asking for the case to be delayed is deeply upsetting to cheryl 's parents . ' an independent investigation into the four deaths published in 2006 found ` clear evidence of found abuse ' , ` institutional failings ' and a ` culture of intimidation ' at deepcut barracks . but the report , which had been commissioned by the ministry of defence found that pte james and her comrades had not been ` bullied to death ' and had probably taken their own lives . last july , mr justice mitting and judge peter thorton granted permission for a new inquest into pte james ' death . after reviewing the most recent evidence , they agreed there had been ` an insufficiency of inquiry ' during the 1995 inquest and quashed the open verdict . judge thornton added : ` the discovery of new facts or evidence made a fresh investigation including a fresh inquest necessary or desirable in the interests of justice . ' a spokeswoman for surrey police said : ` surrey police is supportive of the view that there should be a thorough inquest into the circumstances in which pte cheryl james died . ` the force continues to provide voluntary disclosure of documents relating to pte james and has as a dedicated team to complete this as quickly and effectively as possible . ` at a pre inquest review on february 27th , his honour justice barker was asked to consider the merits of holding any new inquests arising from the deaths of pte cheryl james , pte sean benton , pte geoff gray and pte james collinson , together or individually . ` this was raised as a matter for consideration and surrey police will fully support the coronial process . our thoughts remain with the family of pte james .

emergency drug laws are being rushed through in ireland after possession of ecstasy was temporarily legalised as a result of a court striking down a ban on another substance . parliamentarians will sit into the night to pass legislation quickly after the court of appeal 's ruling temporarily makes legal the possession of the party drug , along with benzodiazepines and some so-called head shop drugs . health minister leo varadkar said he is working to pass the emergency laws within 24 hours . ` we had no way of knowing what the court would decide today , but we prepared for this possibility , ' he said . the possession of ecstasy is temporarily legal in ireland because of the knock-on effect caused by a court of appeal ruling striking down a ban on methylethcathinone the move was necessary after a decision by the court of appeal on a challenge to the misuse of drugs act 1977 . the case dealt with the powers of the government to control substances harmful to human health . the three-judge court unanimously said a regulation making the possession of methylethcathinone - also known as 4-mec or snow blow - illegal was invalid . because of the way the laws are drawn up , the ruling had the knock-on effect of temporarily legalising the possession of some other drugs . the dublin government said the outcome of the case did not affect existing laws on heroin , cocaine or cannabis . while the case dealt with the legality of possession of named substances , their sale and supply remains an offence . ` legislation was prepared and approved in advance by cabinet , ' said mr varadkar . ` the emergency legislation i am introducing today will re-instate the status quo and re-control all drugs that were controlled prior to this judgment . ' irish health minister for health leo varadkar is working to pass the emergency laws within 24 hours . ` we had no way of knowing what the court would decide today , but we prepared for this possibility , ' he said irish parliamentarians will be sitting through the night at leinster house in dublin to overturn the temporary legalisation of the possession of ecstasy
the nichol family had never been on holiday to turkey before , nor had we previously experienced an all inclusive package . so as my wife suzie , nine-year-old daughter sophie and i arrived at the marti myra resort on the mediterranean coast , the place was facing a tough test . the reception area was plush and polished , with acres of wood , glass and marble . john nichol with his wife suzie and nine-year-old daughter sophie at the marti myra resort in turkey to sophie 's delight , plenty of kids were lounging around on giant sofas availing themselves of free wi-fi and watching giant tvs . as the adults sipped cocktails at the lobby bar , the hotel appeared bustling but by no means overcrowded - probably because marti myra is a huge , rambling resort with seemingly endless facilities . all 551 rooms were taken when we stayed , housing around 1,100 adults and 500 children . but there was never any sense we were competing for space . this may well be because the site is set in 100 acres , has seven pools , water slides , beaches , an amphitheatre , five bars and seven restaurants . sophie quickly made friends with other british children and more or less disappeared for the fortnight . this is a resort completely geared towards family satisfaction and we were totally happy for the children to play in the pools , visit the various restaurants and go to the arcade unsupervised . that said , i suspect the amount of vegetables consumed at their private lunches was in inverse proportion to the volume of ice-cream eaten . if that was the case they were missing out , as the food was tremendous - endless buffets of fresh fish , salads , grilled meats - and 20 desserts . for a small supplement , guests can also choose from à la carte restaurants . marti myra is in the kemer region , which is dominated by the towering presence of mount tahtali , the highest peak in southern turkey . it demands a visit so we took the cable car to the 7,757 ft summit . at $ 210 ( around # 150 ) for the three of us , it was n't cheap but it was worth it to experience the glorious panorama . the pool complex at marti myra was a hit with the nichols family in true nichol-clan style , this was our only excursion from the resort as we were more than happy to luxuriate on the beach or by the pool . the only other added extra we chose to invest in was one of the # 100-a-day pavilions on the pristine beach . these private retreats came equipped with robes , sofas , sunbeds and a fridge . and if you could n't be bothered to open the fridge door yourself , a waiter would bring over drinks and snacks . we could have taken part in all sorts of activities , from aqua-aerobics to archery , dancing and poolside it 's a knockout-style games . the beach party was a riot of noise , while the nightly entertainment included amazing kenyan acrobats . the kids ' club production of grease had suzie and i doing the full john travolta and olivia newton-john routine ... much to sophie 's utter horror . for a more peaceful break you can simply retreat to the calm of the rolling gardens . marti myra really did offer a fabulous holiday experience for the whole family . sophie was happy - and if children are happy , contentment for all will surely follow . thomson ( thomson.co.uk , 0871 230 2555 ) offers seven-night holidays at the marti myra resort on a half-board basis from # 499pp , including return flights from stansted and transfers .

a group of british tourists taking part in a sunset cruise along the zambezi river were left horrified after seeing crocodiles eat a man , it has been reported . the tour group and their guide were making their way down the river between zimbabwe and zambia when they saw crocodiles feeding . but as they approached , it became clear that the reptiles were tearing apart the bottom half of a human . horrified british tourists saw crocodiles eating a man on the banks of the zambezi river between zambia and zimbabwe ( file picture ) the daily telegraph reports that the tourists alerted authorities - but by the time officials had arrived to investigate , the remains of the body had vanished . it quotes a local source as saying : ` all there was to see of him was his trousers . we have had no information about anyone missing from villages around us , so we do n't think the man was a local . ' trevor lane of zimbabwean conservation group , the bhejane trust , said the body was believed to have been a zambian man . he is thought to have been among a group of 13 suspected poachers ambushed by park rangers in zimbabwe just days earlier . mr lane suggested that one of the poachers was killed in a clash between the two groups and that only nine men made it back over the river to zambia . when the tourists approached the crocodiles they could see that the reptiles were eating the bottom half of a human ( file picture ) he reportedly told the south african press association : ` we strongly suspect it was a poacher . ` maybe he was wounded and tried to swim across the river .

( cnn ) jeremy clarkson wo n't have his contract renewed as host of " top gear " after he apparently busted his producer 's lip and verbally abused him , the bbc announced wednesday . clarkson , who hosted one of the most-watched television shows in the world , was suspended on march 10 after what the british broadcaster previously described as a " fracas " with producer oisin tymon on march 4 . wednesday , the bbc released the findings of an internal investigation into the incident . ken macquarrie , who conducted the investigation , said tymon had been " subject to an unprovoked physical and verbal attack by jeremy clarkson " at a hotel in north yorkshire after a day of filming . " during the physical attack oisin tymon was struck , resulting in swelling and bleeding to his lip , " he said . the physical attack was halted after about 30 seconds by the intervention of a witness , macquarrie said , but clarkson continued to use " derogatory and abusive language " for a sustained period of time . macquarrie said clarkson made a number of attempts to apologize over subsequent days and had reported the incident to bbc management . bbc director general tony hall issued a statement announcing clarkson was being dropped . " a member of staff -- who is a completely innocent party -- took himself to accident and emergency after a physical altercation accompanied by sustained and prolonged verbal abuse of an extreme nature . for me a line has been crossed , " he said . " i know how popular the program is and i also know that this decision will divide opinion . " " top gear , " fronted by clarkson , james may and richard hammond , has made a name for itself globally with risky stunts and a brand of blokish humor that often toes the line and regularly steps over it . clarkson is determinedly anti-politically correct on the topics he rails about , both on the show and in his newspaper and magazine columns . in his statement , hall referenced the bbc 's diversity , saying it was " a broad church . " " we need distinctive and different voices but they can not come at any price . common to all at the bbc have to be standards of decency and respect , " he said . north yorkshire police issued a statement wednesday saying they had asked for the bbc 's report on the incident . " the information will be assessed appropriately and action will be taken by north yorkshire police where necessary , " they said . on march 10 , the bbc announced that " top gear 's " march 15 episode had been pulled and this week it canceled four live " top gear " shows scheduled for next week in stavanger , norway . however , it said the programs would be rescheduled and that all other live dates would " run as scheduled . " hall said the bbc would " look to renew ` top gear ' for 2016 " and that he had asked bbc controller kim shillinglaw to " look at how we put out the last programs in the current series . " after his suspension by the bbc , clarkson changed his twitter profile to " i am probably a presenter on the bbc2 motoring show , top gear . " on wednesday , the wording became past tense : " i used to be a presenter on the bbc2 motoring show , top gear . " co-host richard hammond tweeted : " gutted at such a sad end to an era . we 're all three of us idiots in our different ways but it 's been an incredible ride together . " fans had earlier expressed outrage at the bbc decision to suspend clarkson . even media baron rupert murdoch commented on speculation that clarkson would be sacked , posting a tweet tuesday night in which he described the presenter as a " funny man with great expertise . " an online petition to have clarkson reinstated has been signed by more than a million people . fewer than 10,000 people signed a counterpetition calling for him to be fired . last week , a fan dressed as the " stig " -- the anonymous racing car test-driver who was once a regular feature of the show -- drove to the bbc 's london headquarters in an armored tank to present the " bring back clarkson " petition . clarkson later thanked his supporters in a tweet shared more than 22,000 times . according to the bbc website , clarkson is credited with changing the face of modern motoring journalism . it also adds : " terrifyingly , he might just be the most influential man in motoring . " clarkson has been at the helm of the program since 1998 , and for more than a decade has fronted the relaunched version with hammond and may . the trio 's long-distance challenges in a mix of elite and sometimes barely roadworthy vehicles has earned the program cult status . in 2013 , guinness world records named " top gear " the world 's most widely watched factual program , with an estimated 350 million global viewers . the show is sold to 214 territories worldwide . local versions have been made in the united states , china , russia , australia and south korea . while clarkson 's abrasive style has proven popular with viewers , his on - and off-air comments have earned him a reputation as a politically incorrect maverick who often walks a fine line between humor and offense . last year , he apologized profusely after being accused of mumbling the n-word in a clip that was n't aired . " i 'd actually used the word i was trying to obscure . i was mortified by this , horrified . it is a word i loathe , " clarkson said in video statement posted online . he 's been accused on other occasions of racism , including characterizing mexicans as " lazy and feckless " and using the word " slope " over footage of an asian man crossing a bridge during a " top gear " special in myanmar . producer andy wilman later apologized , calling it a " light-hearted word play joke , " and saying that the team was not aware that it was offensive to asians . last week , clarkson launched into an expletive-filled rant at a charity auction in north london , verbally attacking his bbc bosses . a cnn reporter who was at the event said clarkson swore often as he talked about his suspension from the show , saying the bbc had " f**ked themselves " and had ruined a great show . clarkson later brushed off the incident , saying the rant was meant " in jest " and was designed to increase bids for the prize being auctioned -- one last lap of the " top gear " race track . cnn 's rosie tomkins and journalist monica sarkar contributed to this report .
hewn into a hillside , this is the humble stone and mortar house where a scholar believes jesus was raised . it has been dated to the early 1st century by a british archaeologist who says an ancient text points to the building as being the home in nazareth where mary and joseph brought up the son of god . professor ken dark says de locis sanctis , written in 670 by irish monk adomnan , described the house as located between two tombs and below a church . a british archaeologist has identified what he believes could have been the house ( exterior pictured ) where jesus was raised . dr ken dark said that the humble first century home in nazareth , northern israel , could have been where mary and joseph brought up the son of god in the first century , two tombs were built beside what is believed to be jesus ' home . the forecourt of the tomb seen here passes through the abandoned home . dr ken dark describes it as having been cut out of a limestone hillside and having a series of rooms and a stairway the text was based on a pilgrimage to nazareth made by the frankish bishop arculf and tells of a church ` where once there was the house in which the lord was nourished in his infancy ' . in the byzantine era , and again in the 12th century at the time of the crusades , the ruins of the building were incorporated into churches -- suggesting it was of great significance and needed to be protected , the reading university archaeologist argues . the house was cut into a limestone hillside and has a series of rooms and a stairway . one of the original doorways has survived , as has part of the original chalk floor . the key piece of evidence linking the site to jesus is pilgrim text called ` de locus sanctis ' written in 670 ad by abbot adomnàn of iona ( pictured ) it was supposedly based on a pilgrimage made to nazareth and talks about a church ` where once there was the house in which the lord was nourished in his infancy ' the sisters of nazareth convent matches this because there is evidence of a large byzantine church with a spring and two tombs in its crypt , dr dark writes.the house he believes was jesus ' boyhood home stands in between the two tombs which also matches with adomnàn 's account writing in the journal biblical archaeological review , dr dark says that while he has no proof , there is ` no good reason ' to believe it was not jesus 's home . he has been researching the ruins , in what is now northern israel , since 2006 . the house was first identified as significant in the 1880s after the chance discovery of by nuns an ancient cistern . jesuit priest henri senes carried out more work in 1936 . since 2006 , dr dark 's team has discovered broken cooking pots , a spindle whorl and limestone artefacts . the limestone items suggest a jewish family lived there as jews believed that limestone could not be impure -- and mary and joseph were living in nazareth when the angel gabriel revealed that mary would give birth to the son of god , a baby to be named jesus . the house is thought to be located beneath the sisters of nazareth convent which is across the road from church of annunciation in nazareth . the key piece of evidence linking the site to jesus is pilgrim text called ` de locus sanctis ' written in 670 ad by abbot adomnàn of iona . it was supposedly based on a pilgrimage made to nazareth made by the frankish bishop arculf and talks about a church ` where once there was the house in which the lord was nourished in his infancy . ' he writes : ` the other stood nearby and was built near a vault that also contained a spring and the remains of two tombs . ` between these two tombs was the house in which jesus was raised . from this is derived the more recent name for the church that adomnàn described ' . the sisters of nazareth convent matches this because there is evidence of a large byzantine church with a spring and two tombs in its crypt , dr dark writes . the house is thought to be located beneath the sisters of nazareth convent which is across the road from church of annunciation in nazareth the last attempt to identify the house where jesus grew up was in 2009 when archaeologists from the israel antiquities authority found another 1st century home they believed had been occupied by a jewish family . pictured an israeli antiquities authority worker clears debris during the 2009 excavation dr dark , a specialist in first century and christian archaeology , argues that the house he believes was jesus 's boyhood home matches adomnan 's account . it is located beneath the sisters of nazareth convent , which is across the road from church of annunciation in nazareth . artefacts at the site included broken cooking pots , a spindle whorl and limestone artifacts . the limestone items suggest a jewish family lived there as jews believed that limestone could not be impure . the house has been cut out of a limestone hillside and having a series of rooms and a stairway . one of the original doorways has survived as has part of the original chalk floor . the house is located beneath the sisters of nazareth convent which is across the road from church of annunciation in nazareth . subsequent generations after the first century took great care to look after the site . the house was decorated with mosaics in the byzantine period , suggesting that they were of special importance . the adomnan text describes two churches in nazareth , one of which was the church of annunciation . dr dark writes : ` the other stood nearby and was built near a vault that also contained a spring and the remains of two tombs . ' the sisters of nazareth convent matches this because there is evidence of a large byzantine church with a spring and two tombs in its crypt , he says . dr dark writes : ` great efforts had been made to encompass the remains of this building . both the tombs and the house were decorated with mosaics in the byzantine period , suggesting that they were of special importance , and possibly venerated . ` was this the house where jesus grew up ? it is impossible to say on archaeological grounds . ` on the other hand , there is no good archaeological reason why such an identification should be discounted . ' in 2009 archaeologists from the israel antiquities authority found another 1st century home nearby they believed had been occupied by a jewish family . however they were able to say only that jesus may have lived near the site . along with the home , a number of water sources have also been found at nazareth . they would have been accessed with jesus was alive . this image shows a famous source known today as ` mary 's spring ' the house is located near the basilica of the annunciation ( pictured ) . overall the design was typical of early roman settlements in the galilee

officials in indiana knew that a 16-year-old mentally disabled girl was being subjected to appalling neglect four years before she was rushed to hospital covered in feces and weighing just 35lb . the girl was in such a grave condition that she was put on life support at peyton manning children 's hospital in indianapolis last december . the victim is the granddaughter of steve sells , 58 , who , along with his wife , joetta , 54 , and their daughter , crystal , 21 , has been charged with neglect . ` cruel ' : steve and joetta sells were granted custody in 2009 when their daughter , crystal , abandoned her child scene : sells allegedly locked his granddaughter in an upstairs bedroom without enough heat . when detectives searched the house , they found a mattress , a bucket and a bowl of oatmeal in the bedroom court documents indicate that the teenager was brutally beaten by her caretakers , lodged on a blood-and-feces-stained mattress and forced to eat human waste and go to the bathroom in a bucket . now it transpires that the indiana department of child services ( dcs ) first learnt of her ordeal as far back as 2010 , with the teenager 's harrowing plight brought to the attention of authorities multiple times since , according to the indystar.com . it claims that according to dcs records dated september 21 , 2010 , someone told the body that the victim , then 11 , was ` very malnourished ' , had a bruise on her check and had not been seen in school . the dcs told the family it was going to investigate the claims , citing ` serious medical concerns ' . records show that steve sells was ` extremely hostile ' in meeting about the allegations , but agreed with his wife to co-operate , taking his granddaughter to a doctor and dietician several times . in november the dcs moved to dismiss the case , indystar.com reports , due to lack of evidence . third suspect : crystal sells , 21 , has been charged with seven counts of battery , confinement and neglect targeting her mentally-disabled 16-year-old niece living with crystal 's parents but a report landed on their doormat again the following october claiming that the pair were keeping the girl prisoner in her room for days at a time without food and denying her access to a toilet . the family claimed that the girl was being kept locked up for her own safety . in november 2011 the dcs closed its investigation , saying that it did n't have enough evidence to prosecute the family . last december the girl was taken to st. vincent hospital in anderson covered in feces and so thin that police said bone were protruding from her skin . she was then flown to peyton manning children 's hospital in indianapolis in critical condition . in january crystal sells was arrested on seven counts of battery , confinement and aiding/inducing or causing the neglect of a dependent causing serious bodily injury . investigators say sells played a major role in the abuse targeting her special-needs niece . the arrest came a month after steve sells and his wife joetta were charged with neglect . according to probable cause affidavits , crystal sells was seen on one occasion striking her mentally disabled relative in the head with a plastic chair , wish-tv reported . when questioned by police , miss sells admitted to the abuse and said that even after she had realized that what was being done to the girl was wrong , she did nothing to stop it . ` there were clearly times over the course of the four years where she was involved in the batteries , she was involved in the criminal confinement and she clearly could have gotten help for this young girl if she chose to and did not , ' said madison county prosecutor rodney cummings . court documents show that joetta and crystal sells waited three hours to call an ambulance after the girl was found unresponsive december 1 , giving them enough time to come up with a plausible story in order to avoid prison time , according to a relative . that same relative said the women seemed more distraught by the prospect of going to jail than the girl 's appalling condition . steve sells , the girl 's legal guardian since 2009 , was initially charged with 12 counts of neglect and battery . he was hit with additional charges of theft , perjury and welfare fraud for allegedly misusing his granddaughter 's social security benefits totaling $ 55,000 , according to wthr . jannifer sells and her fiance said they want the girl to come live with them once she feels better his wife faces 11 felonies counts of neglect of a dependent , criminal confinement and battery resulting in bodily injury . the couple are being held on $ 100,000 bonds . mr sells was awarded custody of the girl after claiming that his daughter , jannifer sells , had abandoned her speaking to fox 59 in january , miss sells said she was shocked to discover that her father allegedly had been abusing his own granddaughter . in december doctors at peyton manning children 's hospital recommended taking the teenager off life support , so grave was her condition , but around new year 's eve she rallied . she is now said to be awake and capable of getting out of bed . jannifer sells and her husband-to-be anthony gaw said they want the girl to come live with them once she regains her health . the sells family allegedly kept the teenager locked in a room with only a mattress , space heater , blankets , a bowl with oatmeal and a bucket , according to the documents first shared by fox59 in december . authorities noted that the door had a lock at the top , out of reach of the teenager , and another child at the home said sells would lock the door ` during the day and nights ' . the child told authorities that they would sometimes see the girl 's fingers reaching around the door , in an apparent attempt to get out , the documents said . everything inside the room was covered with feces and blood , authorities said . the gruesome conditions were unearthed after concerned relatives took the girl to hospital december 1 and doctors contacted authorities . they then executed a search warrant at the home . ` if you see pictures of the victim , it 's very disturbing , ' sgt. joel sandefur said told the indy channel . ` we would n't accept treatment of an animal that way , let alone a human being , a 15-year-old girl . ' the teenager and a four-year-old child moved in with the couple when their mother abandoned them four years ago , according to the court documents . the older girl , whose grandfather said suffers from a chromosome problem in her brain , was kept locked up inside the room by steve sells , according to his wife of six years . she had not been to the doctors or to school in two years , the indy channel reported . he told authorities he locked her in the room to protect himself , claiming that the 35lb girl was strong and had previously approached him with a knife . neighbor thomas mcallister told said that sells and his wife lived at the home with their three children . he said that sells had always given the impression he was a caring father . ` that is mind boggling , ' he added . ` that is just disgusting and no child should have to go through anything like that .

sophie brannan , 11 , was killed when she was hit by christopher hannah in november last year a heroin addict is facing a long jail sentence after he admitted killing an 11-year-old girl in a hit and run crash while on bail . christopher hannah was high on drugs when he ploughed into sophie brannan , her friend and her friend 's uncle as they walked home from local shops on november 14 last year . hannah , 33 , lost control of his hired vauxhall astra , mounted the pavement and hit the three victims so hard from behind they were thrown over the car . sophie suffered catastrophic head injuries and died the following day in hospital . her ten-year-old friend had a badly broken leg and the 36-year-old uncle suffered a serious shoulder injury . hannah , the son of a bankrupt businessman , fled the scene in sandbank street in glasgow 's maryhill -- but later called a friend to say he had been ` driving like a madman ' and had hit someone . at the high court in glasgow yesterday , the father of three pleaded guilty to culpable homicide and was remanded in custody for sentence next month . the court heard hannah 's car , which he had hired a month earlier , mounted the pavement and hit the gable end of a nearby building before careering into sophie and her companions . prosecutor allan nicol said : ` this caused them to be thrown onto the bonnet , windscreen and roof of the vehicle before falling onto the ground . another motorist witnessed the carnage and immediately turned back to help poor sophie . ' witnesses saw hannah speed into maryhill road , with his badly dented car being ` driven erratically ' before he crashed into a taxi . the cab driver tailed hannah , who eventually stopped a short distance away . mr nicol said : ` at that point , the accused was trying to pull the damaged front bumper , then he stopped and walked away before starting to run off . ` both the taxi driver and his passengers noticed he was under the influence of some substance . ' paramedics took sophie to the royal hospital for sick children at yorkhill , where she was found to have swelling to her brain , several fractures and broken bones . tributes left at the scene after the crash last year . hannah fled scene but pleaded guilty at high court in glasgow yesterday she remained in intensive care overnight , but died the following day . the court heard sophie 's friend suffered a serious leg break which will require long-term physiotherapy . mr nicol said : ` she also suffers episodes of withdrawal and angry outbursts . she is due to attend for psychiatric assessment in order to come to terms with her injuries and the loss of sophie . ' the girl 's uncle also suffered a number of fractures , but was initially released from hospital two days later . however , he eventually required surgery and is likely to have ` long-term restriction ' in movement to his right shoulder . the court heard hannah stayed on the run for two days after sophie 's death , despite promising his partner he would hand himself in . when police finally arrested him , they found heroin hidden inside his boxer shorts . sophie suffered catastrophic head injuries and died the following day in hospital . her ten-year-old friend had a badly broken leg and the 36-year-old uncle suffered a serious shoulder injury accident investigators later concluded hannah was solely to blame for the crash . they said he took ` a conscious decision ' to drive while impaired and failed to stop because he knew he had taken drugs and was ` aware of the ramifications ' . hannah also pleaded guilty to dangerous driving , attempting to defeat the ends of justice and possessing heroin . he has 14 previous convictions for crimes including possessing an offensive weapon and road traffic charges and was on bail at the time , having been freed from glasgow 's justice of the peace court two months before the crash . hannah 's advocate thomas ross said : ` he has asked to state publicly his apologies for those affected by this terrible tragedy .

( cnn ) when i was a child , a pale specter used to call our house most evenings , eager to chat with my doctor father about her myriad medical concerns . we called her the " white bread lady , " a moniker she earned for one particularly inane call in which she panicked to my father after consuming white bread . she was n't breaking out in hives or having any adverse effects to the bread . no , she was just concerned that some future illness could befall her given that one particular dietary decision . although we all laughed at the time , it was with a bit of shifty-eyed shame . because most of us ( including if not particularly the illustrious ehrlich family ) have lurking within us our very own " white bread lady , " ready to convince us that each cough , sniffle and less-than-nutritious meal might be a detriment to our health . and , naturally , that white bread lady looms even larger when we can type our worries into a search bar and unlock a bevy of potentially distressing information . yup , so quoth google , we all have cancer . according to the pew research center , 80 % of internet users have looked up health information online . while that practice can be beneficial in some respects , the abundance of ( variably valid ) information online can turn us into e-hypochondriacs . ( or , worse , can lead us to neglect getting the care we need . ) read on for five mistakes -- courtesy of a selection of health care professionals -- that people make when diagnosing themselves online . your eye is twitching like an overly caffeinated college student sitting behind a pretty girl in lecture hall , twirling his pencil and hoping to catch a whiff of her lovely shining hair . you type " eye twitch " into google and come up with a really rad website that explains that this newfound spasm is actually an indication that your third eye is fixing to open , revealing to you wonders untold . you are the chosen one . too bad that this trove of " medical information " is actually some dude 's fan-fiction site . sure , the above is an extreme example , but , as dr. kevin pho of kevinmd.com pointed out , " there 's a lot of bad information on the web and information that can be dangerous . " especially if you 're not considering who put up that information in the first place . pho urges users to favor web addresses ending in . edu when looking for reputable health-care info , and to check who is funding the collection of that information . " there 's so much information from organizations trying to sell products or push their agenda on the web , " he said . he suggests turning to sites like mayo clinic as well as troves of information curated by doctors ( like pho 's own website ) when trolling the web for info . and , of course , if a site mentions trolls and third eyes , one should definitely press on . if there 's one thing people like to do online , it 's talk about their problems -- especially mundane things like coughs and headaches and their babies ' various and sundry discharges . that 's all well and good ; sharing experiences with others is enriching ! unless the people you 're sharing with are idiots . " you can easily fall into that rabbit hole and find some forum that really is n't relevant but maybe sounds kind of close , " warned craig monsen , co-founder of symptom-checker app symcat . on the other hand , " sometimes you 'll stumble on exactly the right forum where someone has your same exact problem , and their solution does help . " " health care forums are definitely another tool that individuals can use in order to crowdsource a diagnosis based on their symptoms , " added dr. natasha burgert of kc kids doc . " i think that these can be a really powerful tool not only for discussing potential diagnosis or symptom relief but also finding a forum of individuals in which you can discuss emotional and psychological parts of an illness and develop a wonderful online support community . " the trick is to be wary about the issues being discussed in forums and how germane they are to you . and , you know , if people start talking about homemade remedies fashioned from bleach , maybe click off and see a doc . you know that game " 6 degrees of kevin bacon " ? there should seriously be a version of that called " 6 degrees of cancer " -- as in , when looking up your symptoms online , how long does it take to deduce that you have a life-threatening disease instead of , say , a simple cold ? according to burgert , the root of this whole " worst-case scenario " thing is getting too emotional . " for most intents and purposes , when you 're looking for online health information , it 's about yourself or a family member , " she said . " when you 're looking through that lens , it 's very hard to keep emotional distance . so you can read about a diagnosis that either makes you very scared or calms your fears -- and that 's the path you 'll continue down , whether it 's correct or not . " burgert suggested using online symptom checkers simply to " understand possible diagnoses , find some initial steps for relieving the symptoms and determine if this is something that needs further evaluation or that can be managed at home . " symcat and mayo clinic 's symptom checker let you type in what you 're experiencing and unearth a spectrum of diagnoses and suggestions for when to seek a doctor 's aid . your doctor 's website might also have such a tool . voila , you just increased your separation from cancer by at least a couple of degrees . " i think , traditionally , many physicians are a little apprehensive when that stereotypical patient comes to their office with big stacks of printouts from the internet , " pho said . " but i think more and more doctors are accepting it . personally , i think that transparency of information is helpful in a way . " translation : help your doctor help you . if you 're worried about a particular medical situation and did some research to help narrow down what 's ailing you , share that info with your physician . " i really appreciate when patients bring in information that they found online , because it allows me to guide my instruction and plan based on their true concerns , " burgert said . " people get scared when they get sick and hurt , and they want to use multiple sources of information to help themselves . the internet adds to that physician 's expertise in order to do that . " remember , though , knowing how to use the internet does n't make you a doctor . google does n't count as a second opinion . if you 're unhappy with your doc 's diagnosis , go get one the traditional way . if your ailment is n't going away , all the symptom-checking and mayo clinic-ing in the world is n't going to help you . make a doctor 's appointment . sites like zocdoc make it super easy ( and free ; doctors pay to be listed ) to set up an appointment asap , so no whining that you 'll have to wait two weeks to see a doc and maybe by then " it " will have gone away . unless , of course , " it " is that white bread you just ate . in that case , please stop calling my dad .
china 's space authorities have announced plans to launch over 40 different spacecrafts into orbit in 20 separate launches this year . one of the vessels to be launched is the ground-breaking yuanzheng 1 - also known as the ` space bus ' - which can launch 10 different satellites at once . 2013 was a massive year for china whose scientists launched 16 spacecraft to firmly establish their cosmic credentials . in october 2003 , it became only the third country in history to independently launch a manned mission into space on the shenzhou 5 . ground-breaking : one of the 40 aircraft china plans to put into orbit is the yuanzheng 1 ` space bus ' which can carry 10 satellites into space and restart its engines over 20 times historic : in december 2013 , china 's chang ` e-3 lunar probe became the first object to soft-land on the moon since the soviet union 's luna 24 in 1976 a spokesman for the china aerospace science and technology corporation said the vessels going up this year will mostly be ` communication satellites ' orbiting at around 36,000 ft. director of its space department zhao xiaojin added : ` there will also be some remote sensing satellites sent up to observe the earth as well as navigation satellites . ' chinese space authorities also said a number of ` cutting edge ' technologies will be tested for the first time , including the highly anticipated ` space bus ' . the yuanzheng 1 is china 's largest ever rocket with a diameter of 5.2 meters . it needs to be assembled at the launch site because trains carrying it would not be able to pass through tunnels . its engine can restart over 20 times when flying in orbit and it is thought to be 75 per cent more efficient than spacecraft of the same size . it also has the capability to move old , scrapped satellites out of useful orbit and into so-called ` cemetery orbits ' to prevent them from hindering other space-faring vehicles . in december 2013 , the chang ' e 3 lander - named after the chinese moon goddess - became the first object to soft-land on the moon since the soviet union 's luna 24 in 1976 . china 's national space administration operated the mission which incorporated a robotic lander and the country 's first ever lunar rover . exploration : in june 2012 , the shenzhou-9 carried china 's first female astronaut liu yang into space cosmic : a spokesman for the china aerospace science and technology corporation said the vessels going up this year will mostly be ` communication satellites ' the county announced its aspiration to carry out deep space exploration in september 2010 and planned to send a man to the moon by 2025 . mr xiaojin says work is also continuing to extend china 's lunar program , adding : ` we have made breakthroughs in most of the key technology needed for the chang ` e-5 mission [ which is expected to land on the moon by 2017 ] . ` this year we will conduct more ground tests , particularly ones involving theconditions which will imitate the environment on the moon . ' meanwhile , the chinese government has already begun opening up its its lunar exploration program to private investment .

gold standard : a pot of freshly brewed white smoked tea from the wee tea company , scotland , which has been named the world 's finest cuppa when going in search of the world 's best cup of tea , you might think of heading to lowlands of assam in india , or of taking a trip to the far east and the mountains of oolong . but the finest brew in the world is actually being grown by a northern irishman on a disused sheep farm in scotland , and has just been awarded the prestigious salon du thé gold award in paris . the fragrant leaf is so rare and so highly prized that grower tam o'braan is selling it for # 1,150 per lb - 200 times the usual price - making it the second most expensive in the world . in addition , most of his tea is being exported to china , a feat likened to selling coals to newcastle . the success comes as something of a surprise to mr o'braan , who founded his wee tea company in 2011 with # 140,000 and just three plants . mr o'braan told the times that he spent years on organic farms around the world , studying how best to grow crops in scotland 's cold climate , and convinced himself he could do it . while he initially met with success , creating 2,000 cuttings from his original plants , disaster struck in 2012 when the coldest winter in 200 years all but killed his crop . he said that after the setback he and his wife were too embarrassed to tell anyone what they were doing , so kept their operation a secret . but on valentine 's day last year the plants sprouted again , at which point mr o'braan revealed his scheme , along with his first batches of white and white smoked tea . he sold his first tea at christmas by mail order , with most of it going abroad , and fortnum and mason have now started stocking the leaves at # 30 for a 35g sachet , or roughly # 10 per cup . tam o'braan , who is from northern ireland , developed his tea plantation on an old sheep farm in perthshire ( pictured ) using # 140,000 and just three plants from which he managed to grow 2,000 cuttings and today the white smoked variety was handed the top gong at paris 's prestigious tea awards , making it officially the best cuppa on the planet . mr o'braan said : ` we started with a dream and pursued it . it 's wonderful to have all our hard work recognised . ` some said we were mad but my partners and i knew we could do it , and with two new daughters on the way i confidently expect my children and grandchildren to be producing tea . ` we are in it for the long haul . ' the upmarket palm court at the balmoral hotel in edinburgh has also announced it will be serving the beverage as part of its afternoon tea range , priced at # 10 per pot . executive chef jeff bland said : ` at the balmoral , we are always looking to promote scottish produce to our international guests and local visitors alike . as well as being sold by mail order online , and at fortnum and mason in london , the award-winning brew can also be found at the balmoral hotel palm court , edinburgh ( pictured ) , for # 10 per pot ' i was extremely impressed with the flavours of the dalreoch white and smoked teas . it is even more impressive that the teas are able to grow in our climate . ` as a nation of tea lovers , it is fantastic news that the wee tea plantation has delivered such an impressive product to such a high standard . ` many tea connoisseurs visit the balmoral for our wide selection of loose leaf teas , and we are thrilled to be adding these two new local teas to our collection on an exclusive basis . ' the tea taste test ... by jim mcbeth an urge to delicately raise one 's pinkie in its honour is irresistible . the china cup perched on a delicate saucer somehow demands reverence . the tea it contains has , after all , been 5,000 years in the making -- surely it is owed more respect than your average mug of pg tips . when the warm golden liquid , cooler than one might expect from a cuppa , is raised to the lips , does one notice the suggestion of smokey apple , or a hint of botanicals ? yes , there is definitely apple in its clean , fresh flavour . but as to the botanicals , i do n't even know what they are . pinkies out : jim mcbeth detects a hint of smoky apple flavour and a hint of botanicals in the clean , fresh flavour of the award-winning white smoked tea these terms are used by the visionary who has produced the first tea in the world to be grown in scotland . tam o'braan has created something very special , so special in fact that he is on course to sell it to the chinese -- the tea retailing equivalent of sending coals to newcastle and persuading the people of the inuit tribe to buy a refrigerator . sipping the tea , one can appreciate its appeal . it is unusually delicate and fine . suffice to say , it tastes lovely and one would be loath to gulp it down , grab one 's bag and run off to the office . but as a lover of very strong black coffee and weak black scottish blend , it would take a palate more refined than mine to extol all of its virtues . mr o'braan assures me , however , that experts who know about things , men whose tongues are insured for # 1million , have informed him officially that he is making the best tea in the world . international orders are already flooding in for his white and white smoked teas , which are produced in the wilds of highland perthshire by his wee tea company , based on the dalreoch estate near dunkeld . the tea 's makers believe it benefits from altitude , clean mountain air and fresh spring water which is unique to scotland high-class london store fortnum & mason has already sold 230 kilos at # 2,300 a kilo -- or # 30 for a convenient 35g sachet . working out at # 10 a cup , it is the second most expensive tea in the world . and from today , in the sumptuous surroundings of the palm court in edinburgh 's balmoral hotel , an iconic venue for afternoon tea , mr o'braan 's produce is , in another world first , now up for the public taste test . the prestigious hotel on princes street has secured exclusive rights to put the teas on their menu , a snip at # 10 a pot -- twice the usual cost of ordinary afternoon tea -- with an accompaniment of the ` finest shortbread in the world ' . this is highly pleasing to a man who was once regarded as mad for sinking # 140,000 into the dream of growing tea in the cold ` marginal ' climate of scotland -- and producing a drink of such distinction and quality that it costs 200 times more than the usual stuff . ` the price reflects the rarity , ' said the former chemist , a father-of-two whose wife , gracie , is expecting to deliver twin daughters before mothering sunday . his tea came first in the prestigious french salon de thé awards in paris , which was , he said , like receiving an accolade for making the finest of fine wine . he added : ` we started with a dream and pursued it . it 's wonderful to have all our hard work recognised . some said we were mad but my partners and i knew we could do it , and with two new daughters on the way i confidently expect my children and grandchildren to be producing tea . we are in it for the long haul . ' mr o'braan , 44 , has 14,000 plants growing at 700ft above sea level , more than enough to produce tea for the next 70 years . the wee tea company was originally the brainchild of his partner jamie russell , and they were joined by derek walker . the partners believe tea plants benefit from altitude , clean mountain air and the fresh spring water unique to scotland . mr o'braan said : ` i 've worked in five different continents researching how to grow organic foods in marginal climates . i knew we could grow crops in scotland , and we have . ` the honour of being the most expensive tea in the world rests with a black chinese tea costing # 4,000 a kilo . ` bizarrely , it is not produced to drink but to be bought and sold as an investment . ` our tea , while expensive , is very much made to sipped . ' i 'll drink all the tea in perthshire to that .
an admin worker believes she has found the world 's longest hula hoop after pulling a version of the snack measuring almost five inches from her bag of crisps . vicky worrall , 26 , from runcorn , cheshire , discovered the mammoth morsel when she picked up the bag of cheese and onion-flavoured hula hoops during her lunch break . despite describing herself as a ` hopeless dieter ' , the mother-of-one was able to save the snack , and now plans to sell it on ebay to raise money for charity . admin worker vicky worrall , 26 , believes she has found the world 's longest hula hoop after pulling a five inch version of the snack from her bag of crisps ' i bought the crisps from the man with the sandwich van , because i 'm hopeless at dieting and fancied a treat , ' said ms worrall . ' i could n't believe it when i opened the packet and found that whopper . i kept laughing - we all did - it 's just funny . ` i 've put it on ebay because i 've been wanting to raise some money for charity for a while but did n't know what to do . ' ms worrall 's crisp measures four and a half inches long , and she decided to sell it after learning that a three-inch version discovered by musician stuart hampton , 31 , from darnhill in greater manchester sold for # 712 in october last year . ms worrall 's huge hula hoop , compared to the size normally found the the packs of crisps ms worrall now faces a battle to keep the crisp away from boyfriend lee schon , and her three-year-old daughter kaiyla , in case one of them eats it . ` he thinks i 'm going a bit mad , but also that it 's hilarious , ' ms worrall said of her partner . ` he keeps threatening to eat it - i would be so angry if he ate it . ` we only give kaiyla crisps as a very rare , occasional , treat , but i know it would be gone in a flash if she got hold of it . ` hula hoops are n't even my favourite crisp , i just fancied a bag . ` whoever would have thought crisps would be so funny ? ' ms worrall , who found the crisp on friday , is yet to decide which charity the money raise will go to , but the crisp has already attracted a bid of # 30 . in the listing , she wrote : ' i have what i believe to be the world 's longest hula hoop ( cheese & onion ) , beating a previous ebay seller who 's hula hoop was measuring in at 3 ' long . ms worrall 's crisp measures four and a half inches long , and she decided to sell it after learning that a three-inch version sold for # 712 in october last year ` on measurement mine is a staggering 4 and a half inches . ` only serious bidders please . i will send via special delivery . ' there is currently no official longest hula hoop as such finds are not covered by any guinness world records record category . however , a spokesman told mailonline that the closest would be the record for the largest bag of potato chips which weighed 2,515 lb 7.52 oz , and was made by corkers crisps in pymoor , cambridgeshire , uk , on september 13 , 2013 . record categories involving large food only cover scaled-up versions of the items , which must be made in the same way as the ordinary sized versions , but on a grand scale . ` guinness world records does not monitor cases where people find unusually large versions of an item of manufactured food that has been made in a factory , ' the spokesman said . ` these aberrations are not uncommon and finding them does not involve the challenge of record-breaking . ' kp snacks , the hula hoop parent company , is yet to comment on the find .
lurking off the coast of scotland are swarms of stunning jellyfish - from the common moon to the rare purple striped stinger and the tiny neoturris pileata . and divers matt doggett and richard shucksmith have captured these floating beauties in exquisite detail . the images include a number of bright and colourful jellyfish that are rarely spotted so close to the uk , as well as so-called sea squirts which have been seen in abundance in recent years . the colourful mauve stingers ( pictured ) have tentacles that can grow around 13ft-long ( four metre ) and these eight tentacles are dangerous for unprotected divers.the species is also known as pelagia noctiluca which means ` open ocean night light ' in latin the images are from a collection called earth in focus and were captured off the coast of scotland around the outlying islands of north rona and sula sgeir , some 85 miles ( 136km ) west of stromness , as well as in loch duich . the divers said the further they headed offshore , the more bizarre and rare these lifeforms became and mr doggett , 36 from southampton , said a particular highlight was the mauve stinger . also known as the purple striped stinger , this species is native to warmer waters around the mediterranean , bermuda and deeper waters of the atlantic ocean . another shot captures the lion 's mane jellyfish ( pictured ) . they can vary in colour depending on their size - larger jellies are typically bright red to dark purple while smaller ones are lighter yellows and oranges , like a lion 's mane , which gives the species its name . they are typically found in the waters of the arctic , northern atlantic and northern pacific the images were taken by divers matt doggett and richard shucksmith off the coast of scotland around the outlying islands of north rona and sula sgeir , some 85 miles ( 136km ) west of stromness , and in loch duich . mr doggett , 36 from southampton , said a highlight was the mauve stinger , also known as the purple striped stinger ( pictured ) . it is native to warmer waters around bermuda and is a rare visitor to the uk the images are from a collection called earth in focus . the divers captured various species of jellyfish including so-called mild stingers that grow around 4 inches ( 10cm ) in diameter . these stingers have multiple radial canals that connect the centre to the edge of the flat bell also known as the purple striped stinger , this species is native to warmer waters around the mediterranean , bermuda and deeper waters of the atlantic ocean . it is a rare visitor to the uk but has been known to travel to the western coast of the british isles and many experts believe the movement is linked to global warming . the jellies have tentacles that can grow around 13ft-long ( four metre ) and are dangerous for unprotected divers . the species is also known as pelagia noctiluca which means ` open ocean night light ' in latin . it is a rare visitor to the uk but has been known to travel to the western coast of the british isles and many experts believe the movement is linked to global warming . the colourful jellies have tentacles that can grow around 13ft-long ( four metre ) and these eight tentacles are dangerous for unprotected divers . the species is also known as pelagia noctiluca which means ` open ocean night light ' in latin . mr doggett said : ` despite all the dive gear , you still have to be careful not to get a stinging tentacle in the face so you do approach them with care . ` some tentacles can be several metres long and could sting you before you see the jellyfish . ` so we always took care to look around carefully and point them out to each other . ` it was interesting to see young fish taking shelter in the tentacles of the lion 's mane and mauve stinger jellies which they use to stay safe from predators . ' another shot captures the lion 's mane jellyfish in green , shallower water . they can vary in colour depending on their size - larger jellies are typically bright red to dark purple while smaller ones are lighter yellows and oranges , like a lion 's mane , which gives the species its name . like other jellies , the lion 's mane jellyfish reproduces asexually until it reaches full maturity at which point it reproduces sexually . the largest of these jellies have been recorded up to 120ft long ( 36.5 metres ) and with more than 800 tentacles divided into eight groups . while the smallest of the species measure just half an inch ( 1.3 cm ) in diameter and are 8 ft long ( 2.4 metres ) . while diving in loch duich mr doggett spotted a swarm of harmless moon jellyfish ( shown ) . moon jellyfish are also known as aurelia aurita and grow up to 40cm ( 15.7 inches ) in diameter . they are recognisable by their patterns of spots and streaks and swim horizontally , keeping the bell near the surface at all times . this allows the tentacles to be spread over the largest possible area , in order to better catch food the left-hand image shows a close-up of a species known as neoturris pileata . they grow around 1.5 inches long ( 4cm ) and can have up to 90 tentacles . there are more than 350 different types of jellyfish and some 2,000 variations within these species . despite their reputation , many are harmless . the right-hand image was captured around 85 miles ( 136km ) west of stromness this image shows mr doggett capturing the previous close-up image of neoturris pileata . the tiny swimmers typically first appear in the northern north sea , off the norwegian coast and around kattegat and skagerrak in may . they can still be spotted as late as september they are typically found in the waters of the arctic , northern atlantic and northern pacific . while diving in loch duich , mr doggett spotted a swarm of harmless moon jellyfish . moon jellyfish are also known as aurelia aurita or saucer jellies and grow up to 40cm ( 15.7 inches ) in diameter . they are recognisable by their patterns of spots and streaks and swim horizontally , keeping the bell near the surface at all times . this allows the tentacles to spread over the largest possible area and increase the chances of catching prey . this image shows a mauve stinger in the foreground as a seal swims in the background . mr doggett said that distance of the outlying islands from the mainland ` and their exposure to atlantic storms and swell makes their wildlife both spectacular but also hard to reach . if the weather gods are on your side and the opportunity exists , these sites will have any diver in awe of the beauty within our seas ' mr doggett said : ` the million moon jellies in loch duich were incredible and we returned the following day to photograph them and swim amongst them . as they do not sting it was a very relaxing , calming and enjoyable dive . ` jellyfish are beautiful creatures both in colour and form and it was wonderful to have the opportunity to take time to show them looking at their finest . ' the photographers also captured images of sea squirts , a type of filter feeder that lives on the ocean floor . there are more than 3,000 known species worldwide but many are found in warmer , tropical waters . they are protected by a thin membrane and are typically cylindrical . in addition to the common bell-shaped jellies , smaller species include what 's known as comb jellies or ctenophores ( pictured ) . they get their name from tiny hairs called cilia that line their bodies and resemble combs . there are eight rows of combs that act like oars to help them swim the photographers also captured images of sea squirts ( pictured ) , a type of filter feeder that lives on the ocean floor . there are more than 3,000 known species worldwide and many are found in warmer , tropical waters . they are protected by a thin membrane and are typically cylindrical

the u.s. could face a shortage of 90,000 doctors by 2025 as it struggles to cope with an older , sicker population and increased demand from obamacare , a new report has warned . the dire need for doctors , particularly surgeons treating diseases common among elderly people , such as cancer , was revealed by the association of american medical colleges on tuesday . ` the doctor shortage is real -- it 's significant -- and it 's particularly serious for the kind of medical care that our aging population is going to need , ' said darrell g. kirch , ceo and president of aamc , which represents medical schools and teaching hospitals across the country . in its 2015 report , the association found that even though the supply of doctors will increase between now and 2015 , the demand for physician services will fast out-grow this supply . struggle : a graph shows the predicted demand for doctors compared to the predicted supply between 2013 and 2015 . the demand is thanks to the affordable care act ( aca ) and retail clinics , among other factors problem : the greatest shortage will be for surgeons , particularly those treating diseases among the elderly the number of physicians is expected to grow by nine per cent over the next ten years , but the demand for healthcare services could grown by up to 17 percent . it predicted there could be a shortfall of between 46,100 and 90,400 doctors in 10 years ' time and , of these , there could be a shortage of as many as 63,700 non-primary care physicians . this is also considering how retail clinics and outpatient centers are turning more to nurse practitioners , physician assistants and other professionals instead of physicians , the report noted . when looking at the cause behind the increased demand , the association pointed to increased life expectancy . ` an increasingly older , sicker population , as well as people living longer with chronic diseases , such as cancer , is the reason for the increased demand , ' kirch told the washington post . the number of people over the age of 65 will soar by 40 percent by 2025 , he said . the association also noted that the implementation of the affordable care act will likely increase demand . but it will do so only minimally - increasing the need for doctors by two per cent . ` the trends from these data are clear , ' kirch said in a statement . ` the physician shortage will grow over the next 10 years under every likely scenario . demands : the association of american medical colleges , which compiled the report , has called upon the government to pay to train 3,000 more physicians a year in a bid to meet the growing demand ` because training a doctor takes between five and 10 years , we must act now , in 2015 , if we are going to avoid serious physician shortages in 2025 . ' he called for more efficient care and more federal support to train at least 3,000 more students a year - at an estimated cost of $ 1 billion a year . the association did note that the shortfalls are n't as bad as predictions in the past ; in a 2010 study , they said there would be a shortage of 130,600 physicians . the difference in predictions is thanks to revised population numbers and the slight rise in doctors completing medical school . the aamc , which is based in washington , d.c. , represents all 141 u.s. medical schools and 17 in canada , and 400 major teaching hospitals and health systems .

military chiefs should resign over defence cuts before british troops become america 's ` cannon fodder ' , politicians and former top brass warned last night . tory mp colonel bob stewart , a member of the defence select committee , called for the joint chiefs to sacrifice their careers over plans to slash defence spending despite growing threats from russia and islamic state . speaking at a meeting of the uk national defence association ( uknda ) , he said the generals should make the people they command their priority and resign on principle , instead of focusing their efforts on ` getting another star ' . colonel bob stewart , a former british commander in bosnia , said britain 's military forces were in a ` parlous state ' and could not take any further cuts later he said he was considering resigning himself , from either his seat or the select committee , adding : ` i 'm thinking about it to be honest -- but that wo n't make any difference . ' his comments came as it emerged more than 6,000 british troops are preparing to deploy under the command of an american unit as part of a high readiness reaction force . fresh details emerged of future military operations after the head of the us army , general raymond odierno , said he was ` very concerned ' about uk defence cuts . he told the telegraph britain will be demoted to a more junior role in future campaigns if spending is inadequate . david cameron has resisted calls to make a public pledge not to cut military spending below 2 per cent - but had insisted he will not cut the size of the army any further former defence secretary liam fox has urged the government not to cut military spending below 2 per cent and yesterday , sir michael graydon , former head of the raf , said the idea of a uk brigade working under a 20,000-strong us division was ` humiliating ' . air commodore andrew lambert added : ` the trouble with this is you provide the man power but with none of the authority . why should we provide the man power -- some people might call it cannon fodder -- when what we would like to do is have a seat at the top table ? ' during the meeting , former military top brass put pressure on the government to commit britain to meeting the nato target of spending at least 2 per cent of national income on defence beyond 2016 -- a prospect which looks unlikely . in a blistering attack on uk military spending -- which has diminished as russia 's defence capabilities increase -- sir michael added : ` it is token already and if we start cutting it any more it becomes laughable . ' colonel stewart , who commanded un forces in bosnia , said : ` if we are really [ in ] a parlous state in defence , why are the joint chiefs of staff not tendering their resignations ? ` they should actually put their responsibilities to the people who they command as their top priority , rather than getting another star . ' a damning report published by the uknda said that if britain is forced into a conflict with russia , our force levels are ` pitifully small ' compared to those at the end of the cold war . an mod spokesman said : ` we will meet the 2 per cent nato spending target this year and next and have also committed to spending # 163billion on equipment and equipment support to keep britain safe . ' general raymond odierno , the chief of staff of the us army , last week warned he was ` very concerned ' about the scale of the coalition 's military cuts
an nhs trust accused of making a woman infertile after a botched appendix operation is trying to cut compensation for the mistake because they say she would not have been earning as much if she 'd had a baby . sarah marquis claims she was ` rendered infertile ' by doctors at homerton hospital in hackney , east london , after her appendix burst in 2008 . the 41-year-old lawyer is suing homerton university hospital nhs foundation trust for # 1.5 million in the belief that it is to blame for her infertility . sarah marquis , 41 , is suing homerton university hospital nhs foundation trust after a botched operation left her infertile but while the trust admits causing her injuries , it claims it does not owe her so much money in compensation as if she had been able to give birth she would not be earning as much . instead it believes she is entitled to # 300,000 , with lawyers acting on its behalf telling the high court that ms marquis 's career would have been hampered if she 'd ever given birth . the court heard how the woman was admitted to hospital in 2008 after complaining of abdominal pains at her gp . she was treated with painkillers for three days before surgeons decided to remove the inflamed organ . but by the time they got round to operating , ms marquis 's appendix had burst and an abdominal infection had set in . as a result she lost her ability to have children naturally . describing the hospital 's role in her ordeal , ms marquis 's counsel cara guthrie said : ` had it not been for the negligence of the defendants , ms marquis ' appendix would not have perforated . ` she would have made a rapid and uncomplicated recovery , avoiding an extended hospital stay , and she would not have been rendered infertile . ' as a result of the botched operation ms marquis had to take time off from her # 85,000 a year job and missed out on promotions abroad , she added . while the trust 's barrister admitted it was to blame for the complications , he denied her claim that she was entitled to # 1.5 million . the 41-year-old lawyer was treated at homerton hospital in hackney , east london , ) pictured above ) in 2008 lawyers acting on behalf of the trust said ms marquis , who is also a labour councillor , would not have been earning as much money if she had a baby . the hearing at the high court ( above ) continues he argued that rather than move up the career ladder her earnings would have slowed down as a result of giving birth . ` the trust acknowledges the fault on its part that caused your injuries and it is sorry for that , ' said bradley martin . ' ( but ) the possibilities are that you would have got pregnant naturally in the six months you and your partner decided to really try for a baby after the negligence . speaking of her long term partner who she began living with shortly after the surgery he added : ` you moved in together in order to have a baby . ' he rejected her earlier claim that had it not been for the operation she would have been selected to work in the company 's american offices as he said she would have been pregnant . ms marquis rejected his accusations . the 41-year-old had undergone ivf treatment in the past to become pregnant . ` if that was my only time to have a child then i would have done so ... ( but ) i do value my career at the same time . ' i wanted to get my life back to normal . i had been off work effectively for three and a half years . '

' i had a chance at honda a couple of weeks ago . i need to keep giving myself chances and keep putting myself back into contention again . ' i think once i keep doing that and getting the juices flowing and feeling it again then hopefully the results will come .

five years ago england beat spain to win the under 17 european championships . the winning goal came from a striker who burst powerfully into the box , between two opponents , before firing home a sweet shot into the corner beyond the keeper . a cool finish on a big occasion . a few months later , i saw him come on as a substitute in the championship and display some clever touches and neat footwork . he stood out as one of the more technically gifted players on display in the second tier game . fast forward a few more months and that teenage striker - playing in the championship - picked up the ball in his own half , ran towards the opposition goal , beat two defenders , wrong-footed the keeper and slotted into an empty net . connor wickham made a disastrous decision to move to sunderland when his career was flying in the championship , he impressed and looked like one of the most technically gifted players on the pitch two weeks after that he scored a hat-trick . in the summer of 2011 he made what has proved to be a catastrophic career move . to those who did n't follow connor wickham 's career before he went to the north-east , all they will know of him is that he is highly-paid , and not exactly outstanding . sure , there was a flurry of goals to help sunderland stay up at the back end of last season , but that has been it . stories emerged last season of his big spending - # 17,500 on a gold bottle of champagne , and a # 140,000 ferrari . these barely make a dent in his # 60,000-a-week salary , and they look cheap compared with team-mate steven fletcher and his # 260,000 lamborghini parked next to his # 160,000 bentley . these underachieving sunderland players do n't mind showing off their wealth , do they ? stories have emerged of wickham 's extravagant spending - # 17,500 on a bottle of champagne , for example in a loan spell at sheffield wednesday , he also impressed - there is no mistaking his ability as a footballer is it something about the club that means these players have no self-awareness whatsoever ? is nobody at the club telling them that all the time they 're so truly terrible on the pitch , it might be a good idea to keep things on the down low off the pitch ? one of wickham 's managers called him ' a playboy model , ' and said he needed a ` slap in the face ' to help him realise his talent . and make no mistake , wickham is a very talented footballer . unfortunately he chose the wrong club . since wickham joined sunderland he has had 10 different managers at club level , including his loan spells . that is not the ideal environment for young talent to be nurtured and flourish . managers come and go so quickly that the pressure for immediate results is huge , so the time a manager can devote to individual players on and off the pitch is restricted . wickham should be spearheading england under 21s ' euro campaign but he has not been selected the 21-year-old has been stuck out on the left for sunderland when he is clearly a centre-forward at a more stable club , the chances are that wickham might have a better environment to succeed . on the pitch he has been stuck out on the left when he is obviously a centre forward . that 's where he did so well at the end of last season . off the pitch , has the so-called ` playboy model ' been guided properly ? evidence suggests not : gus poyet even admitted he ignored wickham when he first arrived at the stadium of light as manager . he revealed he did n't even sit down and talk to the player . sunderland signed wickham but their duty does n't stop there . they need to provide that player with every chance to succeed . hopefully stability will reign at the stadium of light in the near future , wickham will get the right guidance off the field , and he will be allowed to play to his strengths on the field . sunderland need to provide their players with a chance to succeed but wickham has not been guided sunderland are a basket case of a club and wickham made the wrong decision when he joined them five years on from scoring a wonderful goal to win the european championship for england i am disappointed wickham is nowhere near the senior squad as we prepare for a euro 2016 qualifier this week . even more worrying , repeated pull-outs from the under 21 squads mean he 's way down the pecking order , even with injuries this week . he should be spearheading our charge to the euros in the czech republic this summer . the ongoing debate about english talent failing to develop after promising early signs needs to look at examples like wickham . all the ability , but no significant strides made . he should have made that progression . the fact that he has n't is down to sunderland being a complete basket case of a club . let 's hope for wickham 's sake -- and england 's -- the next chapter for sunderland will help him become the player he should be .

jeremy clarkson , pictured , has been compared to jimmy savile by a senior bbc manager in advance of a probe into the latest top gear incident the bbc launched an astonishing attack on jeremy clarkson yesterday , comparing him to sex offender jimmy savile and urging him to check into rehab . blaming the now notorious ` fracas ' with a top gear producer on ` personal issues ' , one of the most senior corporation executives said clarkson was ` self-destructing ' and needed help . most controversially , the tv chief , who has been directly involved in the fallout from the incident , likened clarkson 's supporters -- including the prime minister -- to those who turned a blind eye to savile 's appalling crimes . last night , friends of the 54-year-old presenter expressed disbelief that the bbc should make such explosive claims before its internal investigation into the controversy has even begun . ` i am in total shock that someone at the bbc would attack their own talent and deliberately smear jeremy , ' said perry mccarthy , who was top gear 's mysterious test driver the stig . the broadside came as further details of the alleged assault on producer oisin tymon emerged . one report claimed clarkson split tymon 's lip with a punch , leaving him needing hospital treatment . other sources told this newspaper that clarkson had not been drinking -- and that the row was not entirely about the lack of a hot meal at the end of a day 's filming . but the most astonishing development came during a wide-ranging official briefing given to the mail on sunday by a senior bbc figure . the executive likened 36-year-old tymon 's position to that of savile 's victims , who feared they would not be believed while he was alive . ` the pressure this guy [ tymon ] is under is so savilesque in a way , ' he said , adding that clarkson 's support from high-level politicians recalled the way savile was once defended . ` if you look at what david cameron says or what [ former culture and media secretary ] maria miller says and you swap clarkson for savile , you get this : david cameron is effectively saying that savile 's a real talent , maria miller saying savile will be savile . ' the comparison will inevitably anger savile 's victims . conservative mp conor burns , who sits on the culture , media and sport select committee , said that ` it is not just patently absurd , it 's also deeply offensive to jeremy clarkson and those innocent people who were horribly abused by savile ' . the bbc executive also said that attempts to suggest the ` fracas ' was part of a wider battle between clarkson and danny cohen , the bbc 's powerful director of television , were misleading . clarkson is said to have a difficult relationship with cohen , who told him that he was on a final warning after a string of controversies . ` people keep saying that this is a case of danny cohen v jeremy clarkson . it is not , ' said the executive . ` this is jeremy clarkson v jeremy clarkson ... danny is not the person who is driving this , it is jeremy . ' referring to the top gear host 's much-publicised split from his wife frances after 21 years , the bbc chief added : ` it is common knowledge he has personal issues ; we have all read about them . ` if i was advising him i would take one of two options . do what he is doing now and continue to try to play it down -- or i would go into rehab and show the world i am trying to change . ` the bbc has stood by him before when he has been in hot water ... but this is more serious . ' bbc director of television danny cohen , pictured , is said to have a difficult relationship with jeremy clarkson the bbc producer involved in the ` fracas ' with jeremy clarkson is privately terrified he is going to lose his job , sources claimed . oisin tymon has been working on the top gear franchise in various roles since 2005 and has also been an assistant producer on bbc one 's the one show . but the 36-year-old has been in hiding all week , when it emerged he had been punched by the presenter . one insider close to his legal team at slater and gordon described tymon as ` mortified ' . ` he is terrified that he might lose the job he loves and has been doing for the past six years . all he wants to do is to get back to work , ' they told the sunday mirror . ` he is mortified by the whole thing . ' bbc sources have claimed that top gear would survive without clarkson as other shows -- including have i got news for you and strictly come dancing -- have coped with the loss of a much-loved presenter . they added about tymon : ` we would hope he will continue to be employed by the bbc after this matter is resolved . ' clarkson is being represented by law firm olswang , which refused to comment . as the row intensified , sources in the clarkson camp gave the mail on sunday what they say is the most definitive account yet of the events leading to the hotel incident . contrary to what has been widely reported , they insisted the presenter had not been drinking beforehand -- although co-presenter james may downed a bottle of white wine . neither did clarkson explode with anger at the hotel just because he could n't have an expensive steak . ` yes , it is true that there was no supper but he was angry because they did n't have enough producers during the day and it made filming extremely difficult , ' said one source . others close to the star -- who has been suspended by the bbc -- accurately predicted the corporation would cast him as a man careering ` off the rails ' . even so , the depth of the attack , and the personal nature of the comments , will surprise many -- especially as , until now , the corporation has been careful to limit its comments ahead of the inquiry . the executive 's comments drew a furious reaction from clarkson supporters . perry mccarthy added : ` this will be a nightmare for jeremy and he will feel deeply concerned that someone at the corporation has spoken his name in the same sentence as that disgusting creature jimmy savile . ` it is ill-conceived , as was the decision to suspend him and take top gear off the air . jeremy is a brilliant broadcaster and a fantastic guy . ` it 's atrocious that these idiots at the bbc are paid so much money but run it about as well as a three-year-old child . ' clarkson is accused of punching tv producer oisin tymon , pictured , after a day 's filming in yorkshire clarkson , may and richard hammond had been filming in surrey all day before the incident . they left at just after 6pm for a two-and-half-hour helicopter flight to the luxury simonstone hall hotel in the yorkshire dales . on board , may drank a bottle of wine , but clarkson drank nothing as he had to work on a script later that evening . a senior bbc source has reportedly told people that clarkson 's much publicised split from his wife frances , left , could be behind his melt-down filming had been fraught because of the shortage of producers and clarkson was tired , annoyed and hungry , having had nothing to eat all day , the sources say . and it was against this background , that they arrived at the hotel to be told there was no hot supper . what happened next will have to be established by the bbc 's inquiry . it is not thought that clarkson will dispute ranting at tymon . but he is already said to deny calling him a ` lazy irish **** ' . one account will claim the presenter went nose-to-nose with tymon and said : ` you 'll be on the dole tomorrow . ` i 'm going to make sure you will not have a job . ' the executive who briefed the mail on sunday said : ` [ tymon ] could be in hospital because of this . ` he is watching it all play out . jeremy is a bit more used to it . i do n't think jeremy has got the most to lose . ` he has got the money to see him out through his days if he needs to . the other guy [ tymon ] is just a jobbing producer . ' insiders say the bbc -- which holds the rights to the lucrative top gear format -- is prepared to continue making the show even if it means getting a new presenter or presenters . they say other shows , such as have i got news for you , survived the departure of a host and there was no reason top gear could not do the same . sources said the bbc remained the best place for a fearless motoring programme , because it was not beholden to advertisers . yesterday clarkson looked downcast as he left his west london apartment . he declined to comment but told journalists : ` you must be freezing . ' the bbc claims that top gear will survive if jeremy clarkson , pictured , is no longer involved in the show the bbc disciplinary panel will be led by ken macquarrie , the head of bbc scotland , who carried out the investigation into newsnight 's false exposé of lord mcalpine . clarkson started the disciplinary process himself when he told his bosses at the bbc about the row . meanwhile , a petition to reinstate clarkson has gathered more than 920,000 signatures . the prime minister appeared to lend his support when he described clarkson as a ` friend ' and ` huge talent ' , adding that he hoped the situation could be resolved so his children would not be left ` heartbroken ' . clarkson is scheduled to appear alongside may and hammond at four live shows in norway later this month . all three presenters ' contracts expire three days after the norway gigs . the last three episodes of the series have been put on hold . tonight 's show has been replaced with a documentary about the red arrows .

' the goalkeeper feels that having a strong mentality is key to being successful - especially being a goalkeeper . ` you can feel when someone is in a good place and when someone feels good about what they do , the same as i can feel it with strikers . so , to be in a naturally good place is a lot better . ` you 've got to believe in what you do and feel comfortable and confident when you go out . being in the right frame of mind always helps -- we all have vulnerable parts , times in our game when you 're thinking the worst can happen . but you need to limit them as best you can .

they are the haunting , hooded figures , who walk the streets of spain 's towns and villages during the last week of lent . and these penitents , in their white robes and heavy hoods , were no different as they took part in the annual commemoration of the passion of jesus christ , a mesmerising week-long celebration throughout the country . in zamora , in the region of castile and leon , penitents from ` cristo de la buena muerte ' or ` good dead christ ' brotherhood carry a jesus christ figure as they take part in a haunting night time procession . the ` cristo de la buena muerte ' brotherhood carries a depiction of the crucifixion of jesus christ during a procession in zamora , spain during the emotional festival , penitents from several religious brotherhoods take part in processions , carrying life-size effigies of jesus christ and the virgin mary through cobblestone city streets , accompanied by dramatic drum beats and mournful music . also known as semana santa , during the week-long celebrations , participants wear gowns and conical hoods - a tradition that was meant to maintain their anonymity - during their hauntingly beautiful penance processions . although the most-visited city during the catholic celebration is seville , in andalucia , zamora , in the north-west of the country , is also well known for its 16 religious brotherhoods and fraternities . in 1986 , holy week in zamora was declared a tourist interest of spain and visitors continue to descend on the city in the lead-up to easter , particularly to line the streets to view the scheduled processions . the fraternities weave their way through the city streets from early morning until late into the night . the ` good dead christ ' brotherhood take part in one of hundreds of easter holy week processions on tuesday , march 31 brothers from the ` cristo de la buena muerte ' fraternity turn off their torches as they walk barefoot through the streets of zamora visitors and locals watch from balconies as the procession weaves its way through the cobblestone streets clad in heavy robes , the penitents carry large effigies of jesus christ and the virgin mary as mournful music sounds behind them each confradia ( or religious brotherhood ) is represented by different coloured robes and masks , designed to protect anonymity each confradia ( or brotherhood ) is represented by different coloured robes and masks . in seville , there are more than 50 church brotherhoods , some of which date as far back as the 13th century , while in zamora , some documented references to celebration can be traced back to 1279 . the first cofradia founded is believed to be la santa vera cruz or true cross , which dates back to the 14th century , though most brotherhoods as we know them today were created in the 20th century . another brotherhood , the ` jesus en su tercera caida ' group , lead their children through the streets of zamora on march 30 in zamora , the traditions date back as far as 1279 , with the founding of the first cofradia : la santa vera cruz or true cross in jerez de la frontera , spain , in the southwest of the country , the celebration is in full swing a penitent holds a girl by the hand while taking part in a holy week procession in jerez de la frontera , spain the most-visited city during the catholic celebration is seville , in andalusia , though other smaller cities are also frequented hooded penitents from the la paz brotherhood take park in a procession in seville , spain on monday , march 30 while at first glance , the marches may appear sinister , they are a stunning celebration of emotion as brothers make their way to cathedrals penitents in jerez de la frontera , spain , hold candles as they take part in one of many holy week processions in maintenance of tradition , many brothers will carry processional candles and may even walk barefoot while wearing their heavy robes . though at first glance , the processions may seem sinister , holy week is truly a stunning celebration of pageantry and raw emotion . the brothers make their way from parish churches to the cathedral and back again , each bearing their own virgin mary and jesus statues , as well as colourful misterios ( depictions of bible scenes ) and pasos ( floats ) . holy week , as its known , begins the sunday before easter ( known as palm or passion sunday ) and continues through to easter sunday .
the nhs is rationing operations and treatment for patients deemed too fat . an investigation has found that four in five health trusts refuse to fund some procedures for patients classified obese . these include hip and knee surgery , ivf , joint replacements and in the case of one organisation , all routine operations . details obtained from freedom of information requests also show that two thirds of trusts deny some procedures for smokers . senior doctors have described the policies as ` blatant rationing ' and say they are ` immoral ' and ` unfair ' . an investigation has found that four in five health trusts refuse to fund some procedures for patients classified obese . meanwhile two thirds of trusts deny some procedures for smokers but managers said that given their increasingly limited budgets , it was inappropriate to offer certain non-urgent treatments to patients for which they might not be effective . the nhs as a whole is under severe financial strain and is struggling to meet the demands of the rising and increasingly ageing population . last year its chief executive simon stevens predicted that an extra # 30 billion would need to go into its budget by 2020 just to ensure the standards of care did not slip . in the face of such financial pressure , many trusts have begun rationing procedures which are n't deemed urgent to save money . but this investigation by gp magazine reveals the extent to which managers are refusing patients treatment due to their lifestyles . freedom of information responses from 145 of the 211 clinical commissioning groups , ( ccgs ) , -- local nhs bodies -- showed that 38 per cent restricted some procedures for obese patients . a further 63 per cent refused to allow patients to have certain treatment if they smoked . dr richard vautrey , deputy chair of the british medical association 's gp committee , who is based in leeds , said managers were using ` spurious clinical reasons ' to discriminate some patients . he added : ` it 's blatant rationing . ccgs should be open and honest . ` if we 're going to ration a service we should ration it for all people , not just those in particular groups and pretend it 's for clinical reasons . these include hip and knee surgery , ivf , joint replacements and in the case of one organisation , all routine operations . senior doctors have described the policies as ` blatant rationing ' and say they are ` immoral ' ` if it 's purely down to cost saving , it 's not ethical . ` there are clearly cases where certain people 's body size may make it difficult to safely do a certain procedure , but they 're exceptional . ` i think what 's happening here is overt rationing to save money . ' katherine murphy , chief executive of the patients association , said : ` we are aware that hospital trusts are under considerable financial pressures , but we hope that the need to save money wo n't affect patient safety . ` each case must be individually assessed and each decision must be ethical and in the best interests of the patient . ` we recognise that patients do have a responsibility to look after their own health and to be aware of the outcomes of unhealthy lifestyles . ` however , patients should not take the brunt for years of wasteful spending in the nhs . ` it is easy to target vulnerable patients , and we must be very careful not to unfairly discriminate against people who are n't always able to speak out . ' herts valleys ccg in hertfordshire refuses to offer any routine surgery to patients whose body mass index ( bmi ) is above 35 . this is a measurement of obesity and above 25 is classified as overweight , over 30 obese and more than 35 , morbidly obese . and a total of 30 ccgs refused to pay for ivf for women with a bmi of over 30 . the figures reveal that herts valleys ccg in hertfordshire refuses to offer any routine surgery to patients whose body mass index ( bmi ) is above 35 this is equivalent to a 5ft 6 woman ( 170 m ) weighing just under 13 and a half stone ( 84 kg ) . dr david haslam , gp in watton-in-stone , hertfordshire , who is also chair of the national obesity forum said : ` what we hate as gps is blanket bans and you ca n't just take bmi ( a measure of obesity ) as a reason to operate or not operate . ` some restrictions could have a sound clinical basis , he said , but it is wrong to turn away patients based on weight and do nothing to help change their circumstances . ` weight loss interventions must be offered , otherwise it 's immoral and unethical , ' he said . several of the ccgs said that ivf and joint replacements , for example , were n't always successful for the obese patients and therefore not ` cost effective . ' last year managers at northern , eastern and western devon ccg threatened to ban all treatments for anyone with a bmi above 35 to help cut a # 14.5 million shortfall in its budget . they subsequently dropped the proposals following an outcry from patient groups and health professionals , including the royal college of surgeons .

' i realised what was happening after about 10 minutes however i did n't sleep that night because i was really scared for hours after . ' a series of questions posted to yahoo! answers , seen by daily mail australia and purportedly belonging to bilardi , provide a troubling insight into the warped mind of the troubled young melbourne man , who this week reportedly blew himself up in ramadi , iraq , 110km west of baghdad . in this post titled ' i do n't feel like this is my home ? ' two years ago , ` jake ' asked yahoo! users what could be wrong with him as he had never had an episode ` as serious as this ' . jake bilardi in a school photo from year 10 ( left ) - the year he converted to islam , according to school friends - and in year 11 ( right ) before dropping out of school ` my biggest problem is that it 's a bad photo of me , hahaha ' : the photograph of melbourne teen jake bilardi which was first released to show his allegiance to islamic state extract : this one of 60 questions an account believed to belong to jake bilardi posted on yahoo! answers on thursday , an image of bilardi sitting in front of an islamic state flag was posted to twitter he said ` since i was about 11 or 12 years old i have felt sometimes like my home was n't really my home and that it was all a set up .

' i am looking for a job in journalism and i was wondering if good looks are important . i will admit now that i am ugly although i really want to do journalism and was wondering if there is any importance toward appearance in order to be employed , ' he said . in interviews with six of his stunned former classmates at craigieburn secondary college on thursday , daily mail australia was told the former maths whiz and founder of a children 's soccer charity had harboured ambitions of becoming a political journalist . other questions reveal his increasingly devout pursuit of the islamic and parts of his ultimately successful plan to join the fighting in the middle east . one of 60 yahoo! answers questions asked by an account believed to belong to jake bilardi , the australian jihadist who purportedly blew himself up on wednesday charity founder : bilardi co-founded the soccer for hope organisation ( sho ) which removes youths from the streets of uganda and uses soccer as a tool to improve their lives suicide bomber : isis leaked a photograph of 18-year-old australian jake bilardi ( pictured ) in the vehicle he allegedly blew himself up while driving it over the years , he sought advice on how to correctly follow his islamic faith , requesting help on how he could pray at school and at his job , at a safeway supermarket . around a year ago , he even asked if he could still celebrate christmas as a muslim . ` is it alright for me to continue taking part because some people in my family still are n't happy with my decision and i have been trying to make things as normal as possible , so it would be really awkward and weird if i was n't taking part , ' he asked . his final four questions to the online community betray his decision to leave the country , asking about australian immigration processes , including his concerns about how he had made a mistake on his application for an australian passport ten months ago . seven months ago , he asked about the ` outgoing passenger cards ' that australians generally sign at the airport .

they may have been good enough for legendary actor gary cooper and singing superstar barbra streisand , but it seems their christian names are now no longer cool . it may be unimaginable that you wo n't be able to call friends ` gazza ' and ` babs ' in the future , but according to latest research these once popular names are no longer being used for the next generation . according to ourbabynamer.com the name gary reached peak popularity in 1952 in the us , coming in at number nine on the baby names popularity list where there were 38,000 registered garys . however , in 2013 , only 400 babies were thought good enough to be called gary . legendary actor gary cooper was the flag-bearer for his christian name in the 1950s in another name shocker , nameberry.com revealed that barbra , spelled in the same unique way as global superstar streisand , was also out . streisand made her unusually-spelled , condensed name famous in the 1960s , when it peaked at number 511 , only to drop off in the top 1000 in 1971 . to make matters worse the conventional spelling of barbara , a top 10 name for three decades , only just gets in the top 1000 . so no matter how you spell it the name seems a goner . barbra streisand made her unusually-spelled , condensed name famous in the 1960s other names compiled by baby naming website nameberry.com that look on the way out are llewellyn as a boy 's name and claudine for a girl . the popularity of the 2013 coen brothers film inside llewyn davis obviously has not rubbed off on cinema-goers . a common name in wales , with the distinctive welsh double-l beginning , llewellyn appeared on the us list for six decades . bye bye baby : the girl 's name claudine is another one that has gone out of fashion but despite its rich welsh history , literary cred and quirky nicknames , llewelyn does n't cut it any more . while claudine , the feminisation of the ancient roman name claudius , ranked in the top 1000 for first half of the 20th century , then rose to new heights in 1970 thanks to the popularity of singer claudine longet , only to fall off the charts in 1975 . claudine along with most other once-popular - ine and - een-ending girls ' names are now generally out of favour . the once popular welsh boy 's name llewellyn is also out when it comes to babies ' names
the british are happier than the french but more miserable than the irish , an eu league table of happiness revealed yesterday . it found that we are on a par with the germans when we measure our satisfaction with life , and much more cheerful than those worst hit by the euro crisis , including spain , italy , portugal and greece . scandinavian countries ranked happiest , according to the table compiled by eurostat , the eu 's statistics arm . the british are happier than the french but more miserable than the irish , an eu league table of happiness revealed yesterday it was put out to mark today 's international day of happiness established by the un and was based on answers to the question : ` overall , how satisfied are you with your life these days ?

' he has two dreams : to grow up to become a solider and to go back home to spend some time with his mother and new sister . the six-year-old , pictured in hospital playing his favourite game , called lian lian kan , on his mobile phone doctors have been able to save samples from the baby girl 's placenta and umbilical cord which will be used to give life-saving treatment to her brother . wu chang , a hospital spokesman , said doctors had supported the parents in their desire to have a second child . he said : ` extracting stem cells was relatively risk-free and painless for both mother and newborn , and offered life to the existing son as the operation has an extremely high success rate . ' the operation is now scheduled to take place later this month . stem cells taken from blood and tissue in the umbilical cord can be used to treat a variety of conditions , including various forms of cancer . cord blood and cord tissue stem cells are considered to be one of the most promising sources of future medical treatments . the first successful cord blood stem cell transplant to treat fanconi 's anemia took place in 1988 . since then , the list of conditions where stem cells are standard therapy has grown to include various forms of leukaemia and neuroblastoma , as well as conditions of the blood and the immune system . more than 30,000 cord blood transplants have been performed worldwide and there are more than 300 clinical trials underway .

' ms shaw , a whole food chef who blogs on health and wellbeing , gave chasely two doses of nurofen on tuesday february 26 as she was miserable after battling the head cold for the past week . this was the first time that the seven-month-old had ever taken any medication before but ms shaw thought nothing of it as all of her other five children had taken nurofen in the past . ` she seemed a bit better after the first dose and seemed a bit more content but after the second dose she was very cranky and irritable , ' she told daily mail australia . ` not what you would expect from a child who has just been given pain relief . ' ms shaw immediately had a gut feeling that her little girl has reacted to the medication and read the back of the bottle for potential side effects . ' i remember scouring the nurofen bottle for a list of symptoms that might signal an allergic reaction , but could n't find much at all , ' she said . ` if i can tell you one thing that has become solidified from this whole experience it is trusting your mama gut . ' the nasty blister on her ear ( left ) and her precious skin shedding off all over her body ( right ) the seven-month old became unidentifiable to her own mother who was told by doctors to expect the worst casely needed to be given the powerful painkiller endone to ease her excruciating pain after a very restless night with her unhappy little one - ms shaw knew they had to go to the hospital . ` she was waking up every 15 minutes squealing in pain , fists clenched , balling over and clamping down every time i would try to feed her , ' ` by the time we got to the emergency room she had a red ring around her eyes , nose and mouth , her neck also was red and had what i thought was bad nappy rash . ' after several tests including an ultrasound they were sent home with a diagnosis of a viral infection . but the next morning , chasely had several nasty blisters on her face and neck , and a very painful one on her ear which was weeping , her nappy rash had become even worse and she had become pale and very ill . they went back to the hospital , where anxieties were even further heightened when the doctors had no idea what was wrong with poor chasely . ` the day in emergency was quite scary , i remember reading the faces of the staff and seeing worry , but more than anything seeing confusion , ' she said . ' a kind of look that they had no idea what was going on with my baby girl . ' ' i hugged her , i whispered in her ear that i needed her to fight on , ' ms shaw said to her sick little girl finally a specialist paediatric doctor suggested it may have been an extremely rare condition called steven johnson 's syndrome - a potentially deadly skin disease that usually results from a drug reaction . ` doctors came from all around that afternoon to see chasely and her skin , it terrified me that all these doctors had never seen anything like it before , ' she said . ' i mean how could they fix her if they did n't even know what it was ? ' chasely was treated with a high dose antibiotics and panadol for her excruciating pain . ` through thursday night she was checked almost hourly , her entire skin was red and hot , she was in such agony and squealed in so much pain . ` she would n't sleep away from my arms and even the slightest movement could hurt her . ' when ms shaw woke on friday morning , she said she could n't even recognise her own baby . ' a doctor told me to prepare for the worst , that my baby girl was extremely sick and extremely fragile . ` my heart completely shattered - i thought we would lose her . ' it was at this point that ms shaw broke down unable to comprehend a life without her beautiful little girl . ` once i got baby chasely to sleep , i escaped to the bathroom and sobbed , ' she said . ' i did n't know how to fix this , what do i do next ? i could only give myself over to the hospital , and to a higher power . ' but ms shaw decided they were not giving up without a fight . ' i returned and i hugged her , i whispered in her ear that i needed her to fight on , just fight this off and we will go home . i gave her all my energy and all my love , ' she said . ms shaw cried when she saw chasely catch a glimpse of herself in the mirror and start laughing by monday chasely 's fluid infusions were removed and she was becoming increasingly more like herself numbing gel was used in chasely 's mouth so she could continue feeding and breast milk was used on her wounds along with lukewarm baths with paraffin and later with paw paw . the pain was so bad that she had to be given endone which ms shaw said was extremely frightening as it 's such a heavy duty pain killer but knew she had no choice . finally , by saturday afternoon , chasely started to improve - she was able lay on a bed and look around . ` my sister and eldest daughter came to visit and danced for her with toys , and though she could n't smile and laugh i could see she was amused , ' she said . the following day , her swelling started to go down and parts of her body that had blistered first started to heal and ms shaw began to recognise her little girl again . by monday her fluid infusions were removed and she was becoming increasingly more like herself . ' i cried when i saw her catch a glimpse of herself in the mirror and start laughing . ' chasely was released from hospital on tuesday where her skin could be treated at home . almost two weeks on from the traumatic experience that almost robbed chasely of her young life , you would never know anything was wrong with the miraculous little girl . ` we are absolutely blessed - it puts everything into perspective and everything else just drops away - nothing else in the world matters . ' almost two weeks on from the traumatic experience that almost robbed chasely of her young life , you would never know anything was wrong with the miraculous little girl she does n't know how she could have gone on if chasely did n't courageously bounce back from such a debilitating state . ` i 'm not sure i would have coped very well - i ca n't imagine going through what some parents have , ' she said . chasely must now avoid all steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and ms shaw says that they still have a long journey ahead to learn more about her daughter 's condition . but she insists she feels no animosity towards nurofen . ` i 'm not waging a war on pharmaceutical companies - i just want to educate and empower people on what can happen , ' she said . ` but there is a list of 300 different medications , antibiotics and even vitamins that she can never have so there a lot more to learn on our journey .

a man wanted by police made a couple of critical mistakes that led to his capture - he sent out snapchat messages pinpointing his location . the somerset county sheriff 's office had been looking for christopher wallace , of fairfield , maine for several weeks in connection with a burglary in january . police told the morning sentinel that on sunday night they received tips from people who said wallace , 24 , had posted on snapchat that he had returned to his fairfield home . snapped up : wanted man christopher wallace was caught by police on sunday at his home in maine after posting messages on snapchat which pinpointed his location the somerset county sheriff 's office posted on facebook on monday : ` over the past few weeks , since our press release looking for the public 's assistance in locating him , mr wallace had become cocky . which led to his downfall . this is where our story picks up . ` using the snapchat app , wallace posted that he was at his house in fairfield , which prompted people to call the sheriff 's office .

cats can sometimes be a mystery , even to their owners . but our felines friends may not be as difficult to understand as you might think , with clues to their personality hidden in their features . this is according to a california-based cat behaviourist who has identified three different types of cat face shape that she says can accurately reveal personality . ` cats with square faces are often keen to please their owners . ` square cats tend to be affectionate and love to snuggle and give head-butts , ' said cat behaviourist , arden moore ` cat face geometry is one of the best tools for matching a cat to a person , ' says arden moore , author of ` fit cat : tips & tricks to give your pet a longer , healthier , happier life ' . ` it especially helps with " mutt " cats whose breed can not be determined . ' while moore 's theory is not based on any scientific study , she says experience has revealed there is a strong link between looks and personality . this may be because different breeds of cats , with distinct behaviours , often have the same face shape . for instance , some cats , such as main coon , can have square faces and bodies . these cats are often keen to please their owners . ` square cats tend to be affectionate and love to snuggle and give head-butts , ' said moore . triangular cats have been referred to as ` the herding dogs of the cat world . ' triangular cats are thought to do best in active households and are usually busy , curious , smart and vocal cats with round faces have flatter features , large eyes , circular heads and rounded bodies . arden moore describes them as the ` lap dogs ' of the feline world . ` they tend to be low-energy , easily frightened , submissive cats that gently display their affection to trusted family members , ' she said according to a report in the new york post , the best type of owner for these cats is one that has a a social life , works a 9-to-5 job and has a family who will play with the pet . meanwhile , also have flatter features , large eyes , circular heads , and rounded bodies , such as a persian cat . moore describes them as the ` lap dogs ' of the feline world , and ` library cats ' . square - ` the retrievers ' these cats are often large with square faces and bodies . maine coon , the largest domesticated breed of cat , falls into this category . they have been described as the ` retrievers of the cat world . ' cats with square faces are often keen to please their owners . ` square cats tend to be affectionate and love to snuggle and give head-butts , ' said cat behaviourist , arden moore . ideal owner : works a 9-to-5 job and has a family who will play with the pet . round - ` the lapdogs ' cats with round faces also have flatter features , large eyes , circular heads , and rounded bodies . an example would be the persian cat . arden moore describes them as the ` lap dogs ' of the feline world . ` they tend to be low-energy , easily frightened , submissive cats that gently display their affection to trusted family members , ' she said . ideal owner : a homebody who enjoys spending time with the cat in a quiet environment . triangular - ` the herders ' cats with triangular faces include siamese or abyssinian cats . they are sleek and lanky cats , often boasting big ears and faces that narrow at the nose . they have been referred to as ` the herding dogs of the cat world . ' triangular cats are thought to do best in active households and are usually busy , curious , smart and vocal . ideal owner : someone who wants to show off their pet and teach it tricks , and who does n't own , another submissive cat . ` they tend to be low-energy , easily frightened , submissive cats that gently display their affection to trusted family members , ' moore told petsbest.com . the ideal companion would be a homebody who enjoys spending time with the cat in a quiet environment . cats with triangular faces include siamese or abyssinian cats . they are sleek and lanky cats , often boasting big ears and faces that narrow at the nose . they have been referred to as ` the herding dogs of the cat world . ' triangular cats are thought to do best in active households and are usually busy , curious , smart and vocal . most would prefer to look out of a window and watch the scenery than snuggle on your lap . moore says they are the perfect cats for people who want to teach their pets tricks . she adds that basing a cat 's face shape on their personality is remains a theory and not based on scientific studies . cats with triangular faces ( left ) are busy , curious , smart and vocal , while cats with rounder faces ( right ) are more affectionate , quiet and shy

criticism : home secretary theresa may ( pictured at the house of commons yesterday ) launched a blistering attack on the human rights group cage theresa may last night launched a blistering attack on the human rights group cage , saying no excuses could be made for the appalling crimes of islamic state . in a statement to the commons , the home secretary said : ` i condemn anyone who attempts to excuse that barbarism in the way that has been done by cage . ' politicians have queued up to denounce the group 's research director asim qureshi , who has described is killer mohammed emwazi as a ` beautiful young man ' and accused the security services of radicalising him . jacqui smith , a labour former home secretary , said yesterday : ` we can -- and should -- dismiss the outrageous apologists of cage who claimed that emwazi was just a good lad radicalised by the actions of western authorities . ' the backlash continued with amnesty international coming under pressure to cut its ties with cage . a former employee urged the charity to stop treating the group as human rights defenders and heroes . gita sahgal , a former head of amnesty international 's gender unit , was forced out of the organisation in 2010 after describing cage as jihadis and questioning the championing of former guantanamo inmates . controversial group : cage research director asim qureshi ( left ) speaks next to political activist john rees ( centre ) and cage spokesman cerie bullivant ( right ) during a press conference in london last thursday ` immense damage has been done to amnesty , not least because they wo n't come clean about their association with cage , ' she told the bbc . ` they say various things like , they do n't work with them , they have never worked with them , or they are in a loose coalition with them . ` but the point is , whether they are in a tight embrace or a loose coalition , they have taken their research from them , they have shared logos with them , they have produced briefing papers together , they have signed letters to the government together , that is working with the organisation .

' steve crawshaw , of the office of the secretary general at amnesty , admitted yesterday it was ` highly unlikely ' they would work with cage again . asked if amnesty had played to a ` myth ' of victimisation , mr crawshaw added : ` i do n't think we have played to anybody 's myth . i ca n't condemn strongly enough anybody , in any context who seeks to find some justification somehow for how they can justify killing civilians . ` our colleagues there ( in iraq ) are risking lives in order to document the terrible crimes of is and therefore to hear somehow that we are turning away from those things , i do think is quite extraordinary . ' amnesty international was forced yesterday to admit that it worked alongside cage as recently as october . with liberty , justice and five other mainstream human rights groups , it joined with cage in a ` collective ' to make representations to an inquiry into the treatment of british army detainees . cage 's current director : former guantanamo bay prisoner moazzam begg ( pictured ) has been described as ` britain 's most famous supporter of the taliban ' by the former head of amnesty international 's gender unit amnesty international uk director kate allen said yesterday : ` amnesty has no formal or financial relationship with cage . ` amnesty has , along with a number of others human rights organisations , worked on issues relating to guantanamo and torture . ` this has included being co-signatories on letters calling for an independent , judge-led inquiry into uk complicity in torture . we support the call for a torture inquiry . we do not support all of cage 's views or agree with how it expresses them .

approved full fiscal-year funding for the united states ' domestic security agency on tuesday , dealing a blow to conservative republicans who wanted congress to hold out for a bill that included language blocking president barack obama 's recent executive orders on immigration . the house , 257-167 , backed a senate-passed funding bill stripped of any immigration provisions , ending a bitter fight that raised new questions about house speaker john boehner 's ability to manage fractious conservatives , who accused him of ` capitulation ' after the tuesday vote obama has said he will sign the funding bill for the department of homeland security , which spearheads domestic was scheduled to end at midnight on friday . house speaker john boehner of ohio walks to the house chamber on tuesday as it votes on funding for the homeland security department without provisions attached to counter president barack obama 's executive actions on immigration . they suffered embarrassing internal divisions that left the country within hours of a partial agency shutdown last week but passed a full fiscal-year funding bill today the agency came within hours of a partial shutdown last week but the house approved a one-week extension of funding that was later approved by voice vote in the senate and signed into law by the president . the drama began in december when the legislative branch passed a measure appropriating money to every single government agency through sept. 30 but dhs , which it only funded through the end of february . republicans hoped that once they took the majority in january they would have the resources to use the spending bill as a cudgel against democrats . yet after weeks of bickering , boehner ultimately found himself last week with few - if any - viable procedural options to keep the agency open while also satisfying conservatives who wanted the funding bill to block obama 's executive actions last year lifting the threat of deportation for millions of undocumented residents . senate democrats had repeatedly blocked a house-passed bill that included the immigration provisions , while obama and democrats backed a ` clean ' funding bill passed by the senate . ` what direction do we have ? ' house majority leader kevin mccarthy told reporters on tuesday . meanwhile , many of the gop 's rank and file seemed ready for the whole debacle to be over . ` it 's time to move forward and stop playing these silly games , ' rep. charlie dent , a moderate pennsylvania republican , said . ` let 's prove to the american people that we 're serious about protecting this homeland and that we have the capacity to govern . ' i do give john boehner credit , ' new york rep. peter king said . rep. mike simpson of idaho said he 's against obama 's immigration directives , but the ` security of the homeland is one of our highest priorities . ' several republicans said they would be better served by putting their energy into legal strategies to overturn obama 's immigration actions , which have been put on hold by the courts . ` this is where we must focus our actions , ' said republican rep. mike simpson of idaho . senate democratic leader harry reid applauded the passage of the house bill while opining that ` many weeks were wasted on political games that left us staring a homeland security shutdown square in the face . ' ` if this ordeal teaches us one thing , it is that for the sake of our country we must stop governing by crisis , ' he said , calling it an ` unnecessary showdown . ' ` common ground should be something we seek , not run away from -- especially when the security of our nation is at stake . if we are going to get anything done , we must not be afraid of working together . ' taking a victory lap , virginia democrat tim kaine said in a statement that he looked forward to working with his fellow senators reforming the immigration process ` now that dhs funding is no longer being held hostage over the president 's immigration executive action . ' department of homeland security chief jeh johnson said early tuesday evening in a statement that congress ` has done a good thing . ' the obama administration official thanked members ` who showed the leadership necessary to get the job done ' and gave dhs personnel a ` vote of confidence in the importance of their work . ' ` now our men and women can return to the vital work of combatting terrorism , ensuring border security , port security , aviation security , cybersecurity , and our other vital homeland security missions , without the uncertainty of a furlough or a delayed paycheck hanging over their heads , ' he said . boehner went from high-flying on tuesday to chagrined . he 's pictured here on tuesday morning with israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu after a joint meeting of congress on capitol hill . sen. orrin hatch of utah applauds at right some conservatives said the house was making a mistake by caving to democrats ' demands in the immigration battle . ` yes , the recent court action gives us some hope that the judicial branch will finally rein in this lawless president , ' alabama rep. martha roby said in a statement . ` however , i believe congress had a responsibility to use its appropriations authority to stop this lawlessness and uphold the checks and balances that exist to protect liberty . ' ` this is a very , very sad day , ' said republican representative matt salmon of arizona . ` if we 're not going to fight now , when are we going to fight ? ' conservative firebrand steve king of iowa argued that ` this is the signal of capitulation . ' ` the mood of this thing is such that to bring it back from the abyss is very difficult . ' house judiciary chairman bob goodlatte said he voted against the bill because ` the stakes are too high to surrender . ' ` this fight is not about immigration ; it 's about the constitution and preserving the rule of law , ' he asserted . ` if we do n't stop president obama 's executive overreach on immigration , future presidents will continue to expand the power of the executive branch and encroach upon individual liberty . goodlatte , a virginia republicans , said congress must use ` all the tools ' at its ` disposal to stop the president 's egregious abuse of authority . ' his committee will consider a bill later this week that would prohibit the federal government from using funds to enact obama 's mandates . ` we must do all we can within our constitutional authority to stop president obama 's lawlessness , ' he said . alabama sen. jeff sessions , the greatest detractor of obama 's immigration actions in the upper chamber , vowed on tuesday to keep battling . ` when it comes to defending our sovereignty there is no " moving on , " ' he said just before the house vote . ` now is not the time for recrimination ; now is the time for renewed determination . ' ` those who think this fight is over could not be more mistaken ; it is only beginning , ' he stated . senate minority leader harry reid , center , flanked by senator chuck schumer , left , and dick durbin , right , is pictured here on tuesday at the capitol . reid applauded the passage of the house bill on tuesday while opining that ` many weeks were wasted on political games that left us staring a homeland security shutdown square in the face . ' republican house members at a meeting on tuesday that he wished they had more time to battle obama but it was time to allow a vote on the provision-free senate bill . ' i am as outraged and frustrated as you at the lawless and unconstitutional actions of this president , ' boehner told his caucus , according to aides who spoke to the associated press . however , he said , ' i believe this decision -- considering where we are -- is the right one for this team , and the right one for this country . ' ` imagine if , god forbid , another terrorist attack hits the united states . ' rep. luke messer of indiana , who chairs the republican policy committee , offered a similar version of events to reuters . ` the speaker made the case that he had hoped to continue to fight for three more weeks . obviously we did n't win that vote last week , so we are where we are . ' i had hoped we 'd be able to continue to fight , ' he said . boehner allowed the use of a procedural motion to bring up the senate 's funding bill , which passed the house with support from both moderate republicans and house democrats . the bill provides nearly $ 40 billion in funding for the agency , created after the sept. 11 , 2001 attacks , that secures u.s. borders , airports , coastal waters and other critical without the funding , the agency would have been forced to furlough about 30,000 employees , or about 15 percent of the about 200,000 others would have stayed on the job without pay , including airport and border security

a los angeles-based artist claims versace has ripped off one of her designs . kesshia ` kesh ' kumari , who has more than 80,000 instagram followers , used the social networking site to express her views about the luxury fashion house . she uploaded a picture of one of the t-shirts she created with american apparel inspired by her artwork in 2013 next to versace 's offering , which she captioned : ` at least make it better than the $ 30 ( # 20 ) original @versace_official . this looks like a first draft . ' she also uploaded a snap of versace 's # 440 medusa cotton jersey t-shirt and wrote : ` this.hurts . sold out in 3 sizes . from huge designer labels to small boutiques to giant pop stars to fame hungry former friends . ` why ca n't these companies . these people create their own work ? why do these people think that everything that they lay their eyes on instantly belongs to them ? mailonline has contacted kesshia kumari for comment . in an interview with the cut , the london-born designer said : ' i have always had a deep admiration for versace . it 's an iconic brand that has stood the test of time . i am deeply disappointed in this . ` this is not only artwork from a show that took me two years to develop and create . it is not only artwork from a collection that i created for american apparel to provide something affordable and accessible to supporters of my work . ' but this is also my face ! i ca n't understand how something like this could happen . ' kesshia kumari , who is of malaysian and trinidadian heritage , began designing her graphic creations 17 years ago and began selling them on myspace . the versace t-shirt 's description on selfridges website reads : ` versace 's flair for contemporary prints can be seen with this statement t-shirt . crafted from cotton-jersey and featuring medusa 's head printed on the front , simply team with jeans for a luxe off-duty look . ' mailonline has contacted versace for comment . speaking to mailonline , jim dennis , an intellectual property partner at law firm gordon dadds , the english member firm at globalaw , said : ` kesh 's design is certainly distinctive and the versace design is strikingly similar . provided kesh 's design is original , then under uk law it will attract copyright as a graphic work . ` it is for the court to decide whether versace has copied kesh 's design but the similarities between the designs are so substantial the court may readily infer that copying has taken place . if so , versace would infringe kesh 's copyright unless they can prove with clear evidence that they created their design independently and without reference to kesh 's . if they are found to infringe then they may be liable for damages to kesh or have to hand over their profits from sales of the offending t-shirts . ' carissa kendall-palmer , associate solicitor , eip in london , added : ` in short , kesh should be filing a law suit right away . the versace t-shirt is clearly very similar to the t-shirt she developed for the american apparel range in 2013 . on the face of it , kesh has a good case , but will need to gather evidence to support it . ` the design could be protected by both design rights and copyright , and it certainly looks like a bit of a rip-off . many fashion brands rely heavily on these unregistered rights and at times , it can be complicated and expensive to prove their case . she is not on her own here . copying is very common in the industry . ` there is always the possibility that versace has a good excuse but it will take some explaining . copyright infringement is criminal , and if kesh registered her design , copying that is also a criminal offence under the new 2014 laws . if kesh has a registered design , she will find it easier to assert her legal rights now .

the world 's oldest mummies buried more than 7,000 years ago in the arid desert of northern chile are being turned into black slime by climate change . scientists have found that growing humidity can cause an explosion of bacteria living on the preserved skin of the chinchorro mummies . the bacteria then feeds on the ancient skin , causing it to break down into a black slime . the preserved skin on the outside of chinchorro mummies in arica , northern chile , have begun to rapidly degrade as bacteria and humid air is turning it into black slime , as can be seen in the photograph above researchers say that rising humidity levels in arica , chile , is putting the 120 chinchorro mummies at the university of tarapacá 's archaeological museum at risk . however , they warn that hundreds of other mummies buried just beneath the sandy surface in the valleys throughout the region are also under threat . while some of the earliest mummies found in the atacama desert appear to have been the result of natural preservation in the extremely dry conditions , around 5,000 bc , the chinchorro people began deliberately preserving their dead . although the practice began 2,000 years before the ancient egptians began mummifying their own dead , the techniques used by the chinchorro were often surprisingly sophisticated . they would often take the most care when preserving the remains of dead children and babies - suggesting the act had a deep significance with linking the living to the dead . first the chinchorro would extract the brains and organs before then reconstructing the body with fibres . they would fill the empty skull with straw or ash . reeds were then used to sew it back together and connect the jaw to the cranium . a stick was used to keep the spine straight and the skin was patched back together before being covered with a paste made from manganese , red ocher or mud . professor marcela sepulveda , an archaeologist at the university of tarapacá , said : ` in the last 10 years , the process has accelerated . ` it is very important to get more information about what 's causing this and to get the university and national government to do what 's necessary to preserve the chinchorro mummies for the future . ' the chinchorro mummies are in some cases nearly 4,000 years older than those found preserved from ancient egypt . the oldest mummy discovered in the atacama desert dates to 7020bc while the oldest in egypt dates to 3,000 bc . however , the practice of preserving the dead with mummification became popular among the chinchoro around 5,000 bc , with children and babies often being the most elaborately preserved . the chinchorro were a prehistoric people who lived in scattered communities and used fishing to help them survive on the desert coast of chile and peru . it is thought they began preserving their dead though mummification as part of a religious act designed to bridge the world between the living and the dead . an estimated 282 mummies have now been recovered from the dry , sandy soil in the region , but scientists say there could be hundreds more buried there . preserved corpses are often found as the shifting sand exposes their bodies . arica and the surrounding atacama desert is one of the driest places in the world and the town receives less than 0.02 inches of rain a year . the skin on the head of this chinchorro mummy at the san miguel de azapa museum in arica , chile has begun to break down due to the damage being caused by bacteria growing as humidity in the area increases the mummies were found buried in the arid desert valleys around arica in northern chile , shown on the map it is this dry climate that has helped preserve the mummies for more than 7,000 years . however , the region has been growing slowly damper in recent years . scientists at the university of tarapacá museum first noticed black slimy patches appearing on the preserved skin of the chinchorro mummies around ten years ago . as time has gone on they have degraded at ` an alarming rate ' as the preserved skin has broken down into a black slime . researchers at harvard school of engineering and applied sciences have now conducted a series of tests to find out what was causing the degradation . they found that bacteria normally found growing on the human skin appeared to become ` supercharged ' when placed on mummy skin in high humidity . they found that mummies need to be kept at between 40 per cent and 60 per cent humidity to prevent degradation occurring . some of the chinchorro mummies , like the one above buried in a coffin made from reeds , show highly sophisticated preservation thousands of years before mummification began to be used in ancient egypt if humidity falls below this level , acidification could also damage the mummies . museum staff are now fine tuning the temperature and humidity to help preserve the mummies in their extensive collection . professor ralph mitchell , a biologist at harvard who led the work , said : ` we knew the mummies were degrading but nobody understood why . ` this kind of degradation has never been studied before . ` with many diseases we encounter , the microbe is in our body to begin with , but when the environment changes it becomes an opportunist . ' professor mitchell and his colleagues are now keen to find ways to help protect the mummies still preserved out in the desert .
at the etihad stadium last month , one of the most gifted players of his generation was given the run of the place during barcelona 's 2-1 victory . it was an exhibition from the very best . andres iniesta took 112 touches in barcelona 's midfield , five more than his celebrated team-mate lionel messi and far more than any player in a manchester city shirt . james milner , anointed by manuel pellegrini as one of his team 's most important players , was the highest with 64 . the numbers simply do n't add up , which is one of the reasons english football is struggling to make an impact over two legs in champions league ties . when will our game learn ? andres iniesta , rested in barca 's win over eibar , is expected to return to the starting line-up against city barcelona 's croatian midfielder ivan rakitic controls the ball as xavi and pedro look on during training neymar aims a friendly kick at fellow barcelona striker luis suarez after the uruguayan had gone down the brazil captain was in high spirits as barcelona prepared for their champions league last 16 second leg ` we play in a comprehensive manner and we want possession so that they suffer , ' admitted iniesta as he prepares to pull on the red and blue stripes of barcelona once more . ` we need to find our superior skills and minimise their potential . we want to control what goes on in every moment . we have to beat manchester city with a complete performance . ' barcelona are conditioned to play a certain way , all possession-based and keeping the ball in circulation until they can find a way through the gaps in city 's defence . iniesta is a slave to the game , a man still seeking perfection even after three triumphs in the champions league , plus two european championships and the 2010 world cup , in which he scored the winner for spain . barcelona will be hoping to reach the champions league quarter finals by holding off manchester cit barca have not failed to reach europe 's last eight since 2007 , and saw off city at the same stage last season his incredible strike against chelsea in the 2009 champions league semi-final , second leg at stamford bridge is one of the most dramatic goals in the history of the game . at the age of 30 , he wants more . ` we do not gather as a team to discuss what we can achieve , but the important thing is that we know what the possibilities are , ' he added . ` there are no guarantees , but we know that we are doing well and we are prepared for this match . ' luis enrique 's team are in fine fettle , a point ahead of real madrid at the top of la liga ahead of el clasico on sunday and on course for the champions league quarter-final if they can protect their 2-1 advantage . the barcelona players move the ball around during a training exercise ahead of the vital showdown with city manager luis enrique will be hoping his team take another step on the road towards berlin the final of the copa del rey awaits later in the season , when iniesta can add to his extensive list of honours when enrique 's team face athletic bilbao . ` we do n't think beyond manchester city because we have to concentrate , even if we had a good result in the first leg , ' he said . ` right now the team is in good shape , but this is a difficult period of the season . we are in the final of copa del rey , the champions league and all the little details will play a role tomorrow . ` on sunday we have an important match against our rivals , but this is the champions league and manchester city have great players . ' iniesta is wary of the threat posed by former barcelona midfielder yaya toure much will be expected of yaya toure , returning from suspension to play against his former team at the nou camp as city attempt to overturn a 2-1 deficit . this will be a tough night for a team who can not keep the ball , but toure 's goalscoring ability , along with those powerful runs that start from deep-lying positions , could give them a chance . iniesta added : ` he is very important for them , he is very powerful physically and he has important qualities because of all his skills . ` we 'll try to minimise his potential .

britain 's richest woman kirsty bertarelli and her husband ernesto have left their neighbours ` apoplectic ' with plans for their home britain 's richest woman kirsty bertarelli does n't usually have to dig deep to get what she wants . when it came to extending the former miss uk 's london home , however , excavating a vast two-storey subterranean extension seemed the perfect solution . but neighbours in the exclusive street have been left feeling angry -- even undermined -- by the plan to create a family home for her , husband ernesto , a swiss businessman , and their three children . they had raised concerns about the excavation possibly harming the property and adjoining buildings , and about the noise and upheaval caused by the work . adding to their ire , the council is to restrict such developments by the end of the year because of the disruption they cause -- but the bertarellis got their application in just in time . planners at westminster city council this week approved the application , which will add a dining room , family room and cinema area on one of its levels and a kitchen , gym and laundry area on another . sketches show this would virtually double the size of the house in belgravia . staffordshire-born mrs bertarelli , 43 , who was 17 when she was miss uk and also runner-up to miss world , is the richest woman in britain , worth nearly # 9.75 billion thanks to her marriage to ernesto , 49 , a harvard-educated biotechnology tycoon , according to the sunday times rich list 2014 . they bought the victorian house 15 years ago for # 5.5 million . architects boundary space said the ` double decker ' basement is required because the house is no longer big enough for the family , who divide their time between london and homes in geneva and gstaad , switzerland . the upgrade will turn it into a ` modern family home with appropriate facilities ' . dubbed ` iceberg homes ' , such extensions are the fashionable but controversial solution for rich residents with limited space . the likes of andrew lloyd webber , nicole kidman and roman abramovich are among those who have all extended underground . according to the architects who designed the project , the ` double decker ' basement is required because the house is not big enough for the couple ` iceberg ' homes have become an increasingly popular way for the rich to expand their homes , without flouting planning restrictions ( this image of the house has been altered to protect the owners ' privacy ) some homes on the bertarellis ' mews , one of the most affluent areas of the capital , already have basements , but several neighbours had instructed lawyers to fight the latest proposal . while it will be the third property to have a basement , the bertarellis would be the first to excavate to two storeys . staffordshire born ms bertarelli , who co-wrote girl band all saints ' worldwide smash black coffee , released her own album last year locals were also worried that the basement might be used as a recording studio -- mrs bertarelli co-wrote girl band all saints ' worldwide smash black coffee and released her own album last year -- although the plans , approved on tuesday , show otherwise . one neighbour who wanted to remain anonymous said : ` some of the owners around here are absolutely apoplectic about what 's in the pipeline . these kinds of developments cause huge disruption . ` in the past few years there has already been one double basement conversion and a single basement . there will be hardly any earth left eventually . ` the houses were never intended to be enormous family homes and the street is just about wide enough to fit two cars down it side-by-side . ` it 's like we have rockstars coming to stay when they arrive , there 's an army of drivers and minders for the kids , it 's mayhem . ` they are obviously going to spend a huge amount on a place they hardly live in , it 's staggering . but then the richest are oblivious to how your regular people live and we will have to deal with the consequences . ' another neighbour said : ` this is going to be a three-year project , they are going to completely gut the building and dig down , i have no idea how that 's going to be done without seriously disrupting us and affecting our day-to-day lives . ' according to the architects who designed the project , the ` double decker ' basement is required because the house is not big enough for the couple . the planned upgrade , which will apparently take three years to complete , will turn it into a ` modern family home with appropriate facilities ' , they said . the architects added : ` the proposals reflect the client 's family has grown , and the accommodation is no longer conducive to modern family living . ' ms bertarelli , 43 ( right ) , who won miss uk in 1998 ( left ) , bought the house with her husband 13 years ago for # 5.5 million in a report considered by the council , it emerged that there had been ' a large number of objections ' from residents in the mews , who were concerned the basement may be used as recording studios . the complaints were backed by local conservative councillor rachael robathan , who said : ` the size of the extension is disproportionate . ' john walker , the wesminster city council 's operational director of development planning said in a report : ` there have been a large number of objections from other residents within the mews . ` concern has been raised by residents that the use of the basements has not been specified , and that they might be used as recording studios . ` they are concerned that the excavation of new basements is a risky construction process , with potential harm to the property and adjoining buildings . ' ` iceberg ' homes became an increasingly popular way for the rich and famous to expand their homes , without flouting planning restrictions . ms bertarelli , 43 , who won miss uk in 1998 , bought the house with her husband 13 years ago for # 5.5 million but the london borough of kensington and chelsea became the first local authority in the country to introduce restrictions on the controversial subterranean developments . if the couple lived just a few streets away , their plans would not have been approved because of the ban on ` excessive ' two storey extensions . westminster city council is to introduce a similar policy to limit the size of basement extensions by the end of this year . speaking about the approved plan , council spokesman nick thompson said : ` this application was approved by committee on tuesday night . ` we have a basement policy that is coming in very shortly which will restrict this type of development , as we recognise the disruption that residents in westminster are having to live with . ' planning permission was granted with conditions that the excavation work can be carried out only between 8am and 6pm monday to friday . nobody was at the bertarellis ' home for comment yesterday .
bump on the head or not , fernando alonso is the same wily maverick he always was . this most brilliant yet political of drivers , who is apt to spell the word team with the pronoun ` i ' , delivered his disloyal lines here yesterday quietly , courteously and devastatingly . a steering problem , he told a press conference before sunday 's malaysian grand prix , was the cause of the mclaren driver 's apparently innocuous accident during pre-season testing in barcelona last month . just one thing : mclaren repeatedly said there was nothing wrong with their car . calling on every conceivable bit of tele-metry , they compiled a 37-page report , which they presented to the fia , substantiating that view . fernando alonso stands in front of the world 's press as he poses for the cameras ahead of sunday 's race the spaniard is back in action this weekend after missing the season-opening australian grand prix alonso has claimed his steering wheel locked which caused his pre-season testing crash in barcelona ` the steering problem came in the middle of turn three , ' elaborated alonso , who missed the opening race in melbourne as he recovered from the crash that threatened his career . ` it locked into the right and when i approached the wall i braked at the last moment , i downshifted from fifth to third , and unfortunately we are still missing some data . ' how routine steering data would not be readily available baffled most observers , including a host of former drivers . ` i 've listened to alonso 's very clear explanation of the incident , ' said broadcaster martin brundle , who drove in 158 grands prix . ` now i 'm really confused . ' one of the fia 's most senior technical officials commended mclaren 's report as honest and robust . why , then , would the spaniard blame a steering problem when there is apparently no supporting evidence ? alonso is set for his second mclaren debut after he left the team at the end of the 2007 campaign the spaniard was in good spirits as he addressed the media in sepang after being declared fit to race the two most obvious reasons are that he was either too proud to admit he made an error , or a possible neurological glitch caused him to black out prior to hitting the wall ( even though he was changing gears , he may have been semi-conscious as he did so ) . it appears he did not mention any steering problem to mclaren until last week - three weeks after the accident . they then smuggled a quotation from him citing this explanation into the middle of a press release on monday , perhaps to appease him . what they did not expect was alonso to make such a fuss about the issue when he spoke in the sepang paddock . they could not disregard their meticulous data , nor could they publicly argue with their # 25million-a-year driver - relations between the team and alonso still have not entirely recovered from the fractious year he spent at mclaren in 2007 . alonso barely speaks to ron dennis , the mclaren chairman . his relationship with the de facto team principal eric boullier , who was not at mclaren during alonso 's first spell there , is somewhat more trusting but he is closer to andrea stella , an italian who moved with him from ferrari to remain his race engineer . these scenes echoed 2007 , when alonso threatened to report incriminating evidence about dennis to the fia during the spygate scandal . alonso arrives in the sepang paddock for the malaysian grand prix ; the second round of the championship the double world champion in the paddock with compatriot carlos sainz prior to thursday 's media briefing back then , the team were split in two . alonso and his manager luis garcia abad would brief spanish journalists in one corner . the same procedure happened at the team 's hospitality area here on thursday . alonso was again surrounded by his cabal - abad and his deputy alberto fernandez , and physiotherapist edoardo bendinelli - as he ate jacket potatoes as part of the so-called ` boys ' lunch ' ... the meal provided for the team 's mechanics and engineers . by this point , alonso , who arrived at the track at 9.45 am , had been cleared by the fia 's doctors to compete on sunday , a virtual formality after he passed more extensive tests by three cambridge university doctors at the weekend . yet still the mystery goes on . alonso said he was ` perfectly conscious at the time ' of the accident - a version of events that seems to contradicts with mclaren 's public statements and eyewitness accounts at the scene . alonso insisted he will have no problems stepping back into the cockpit for first practice on friday alonso smiles in his car in the garage at sepang , home of this weekend 's malaysian grand prix ` i lost consciousness in the ambulance or in the clinic at the circuit but the doctors said this is normal because of the medication they gave me for the helicopter transfer and the checks they did in hospital , ' he said . ` there is a time i do n't remember from two o'clock to six o'clock , but that was normal on the medication . ' alonso more plausibly denied reports originating in spain that he woke up believing himself to be a teenage go-karter . he said he could remember everything the following day , but then said it took him ` three or four days ' to gather his memory . but not for his team-mate jenson button , who said : ` i 've seen every single bit of data many times . it all says that the car is ok . ' it was button 's polite way of saying what we were all thinking about the confused nature of alonso 's testimony .
indiana gov. mike pence said tuesday he wants new legislation clarifying that a new religious-freedom does not allow discrimination on his desk by the end of the week . the white house fired back hours later , calling pence a ` previously defiant governor ' who has suddenly decided ` to consider a position of changing the law ' amid a ` bipartisan and even nonpolitical outcry . ' pence told reporters he has been meeting with lawmakers ` around the clock ' to address concerns that the law will allow businesses to deny services to gays and lesbians . ` after much reflection and in consultation with the leadership of the general assembly , ' he told reporters during a press conference , ` i 've come to the conclusion that it would be helpful to move legislation this week that makes it clear that this law does not give businesses a right to deny services to anyone . ' indiana gov. mike pence now says he wants changes to a religious-freedom law he signed just days ago , as criticism mounts from gay rights groups protests have swirled around indianapolis since the law took effect , with activists insisting it 's a license to discriminate against gays and lesbians white house press secretary josh earnest unleashed a biting attack on indiana lawmakers near the beginning of his briefing on tuesday . ` this piece of legislation flies in the face of the kinds of values that people all across the country strongly support , ' he said . that , earnest claimed , is why ` we 've seen the governor and other indiana officials in damage-control mode here . ' the law pence signed last week prohibits state laws that ` substantially burden ' a person 's ability to follow his or her religious beliefs . the definition of ` person ' includes religious institutions , businesses and associations . pence says the law has been ` grossly mischaracterized ' and has put indiana under a harsh glare -- resulting in a ` perception problem ' that he has to address . ' i do n't believe for a minute that it was the intent of the general assembly to create a license to discriminate , ' he said . ` it certainly was n't my intent . ' but , pence said , he ` can appreciate that that 's become the perception , not just here in indiana but all across the country . we need to confront that . ' supporters of the measure say it protects their ability to exercise their religious beliefs without shelving them when they enter the business marketplace . opponents insist it gives indiana residents and companies a legal loophole if they want to discriminate against gays and lesbians . the legal language itself does n't specifically mention gays or lesbians but the central controversy surrounding the law concerns whether or not christians who run photography , catering or florist businesses should be allowed to refuse service to people who are planning same-sex weddings . businesses and organizations including the ncaa -- whose iconic ` final four ' basketball tournament comes to indianapolis this week -- have voiced concern over the effect of the law , and some states have barred government-funded travel to indiana . nascar , the stock-car racing circuit , joined the fray on tuesday with a statement assuring fans that ` we will not embrace nor participate in exclusion or violence . ' the organization pledged that it would welcome all fans in indiana and elsewhere . apple ceo tim cook wrote an op-ed in the washington post over the weekend opposing the indiana law and a near-identical bill pending in arkansas . at the white house , earnest said it was no surprise that ` we see business leaders saying that they are reluctant to business in a state where their customers or even their employees could be subjected to greater discrimination just because of who they love . ' white house press secretary josh earnest upbraided indiana republicans on tuesday for the religious-freedom law , which bears many similarities to a federal law signed by president bill clinton in 1993 gay weddings are ground-zero for religious-freedom laws , as some vendors ' religious beliefs prohibit them from participating in same-sex ceremonies three states have banned taxpayer-funded travel to indiana this week in response to the legislation , as well as the city of san francisco , california , and the city of seattle , washington . connecticut became the first state on monday to introduce a travel ban and was followed by washington and new york . new york governor andrew cuomo today directed all state agencies to immediately ` bar any such publicly funded travel that is not essential to the enforcement of state law or public health and safety . ' ` new york state has been , and will continue to be , a leader in ensuring that all lgbt persons enjoy full and equal civil rights . with this action , we stand by our lbgt family members , friends and colleagues to ensure that their rights are respected , ' he said in a statement . connecticut 's governor , dannel malloy , accused indiana of ` outright bigotry . ' ` the reality is , the governor is not a stupid man , but he 's done stupid things . and signing this law and , quite frankly , promoting this law , knowing exactly what it was going to do , was an incredibly stupid thing for him to do , ' said on msnbc . ` but even there , if you get the picture from who was around him when he signed this bill , there were three homophobic men standing alongside the governor . one of them who equated being gay with bestiality . that 's who he invited to the signing ceremony . he knew exactly what he was doing , and when you see a bigot you have to call him on it . ' the family research council , an evangelical group based out of washington d.c. that lobbies against abortion and same-sex marriage and promotes religious liberty , came to pence 's defense on tuesday , saying that indiana has been the target of ` bullying ' and ` misinformation . ' it said critics ' claims about the law are a ` complete falsehood . ' indiana 's religious freedom law is not ` about denying people a seat in a restaurant or a room at a hotel , ' the organization 's president , tony perkins , said in a statement . ` christians would never deny people these services but being forced to participate in a ceremony that violates religious beliefs is completely un-american and uncivil , ' he added . continuing , he said , ` we must ensure that religious business owners are not forced by the government to participate in a same-sex ceremony . ' perkins said his organization would back a clarification in the law explaining that it ` does not impact non-religious goods or services . ' best intentions : pence said tuesday that it was not ` the intent of the general assembly to create a license to discriminate , ' , and added that ` it certainly was n't my intent ' loud and proud : whether or not indiana 's new law actually makes it legal to discriminate , gay rights groups have been promoting the idea that it does pence says the backlash has been the result of a willful twisting of the law 's meaning by its opponents . ` that 's why i think we need to focus specifically on this perception that this creates some license to discriminate , ' he said . the controversy has opened up the possibility that the pendulum indiana lawmakers pushed into motion could swing in the opposite direction . indianapolis mayor greg ballard , a republican , said monday that state legislators should add gays to the list of groups specifically protected by the state 's civil rights law . and tuesday 's edition of the indianapolis star included a special cover emblazoned with the words ` fix this now ' in giant letters , along with a scathing editorial . the newspaper 's editorial board said the uproar sparked by the law has ` done enormous harm ' to the state and potentially to its economic future . pence seemed to be sticking to his guns on monday , writing an op-ed in the wall street journal that blamed ` critics and many in the national media ' for getting their facts wrong . ` the religious freedom restoration act reflects federal law , as well as law in 30 states nationwide , ' he wrote . ' ' i abhor discrimination , ' pence insisted . ' i believe in the golden rule that you should " do unto others as you would have them do unto you . " if i saw a restaurant owner refuse to serve a gay couple , i would n't eat there anymore . '
thousands of square miles of rainforest is cleared in the amazon each year to make way for farming land - a pattern of destruction that takes place all around the world . but despite this , the planet has got greener in the past decade , with the total amount of plant coverage increasing overall . the increase is so noticeable that the world 's trees and plants now store almost four billion more tonnes of carbon than they did in 2003 . thousands of square miles of rainforest is cleared in the amazon ( pictured ) each year to make way for farming land - a pattern of destruction that takes place all around the world - but despite this , the planet has got greener in the past decade , with the total amount of plant coverage increasing overall this is thanks to tree-planting in china , forest regrowth in former soviet states because of abandoned farms , and more lush savannas because of higher rainfall . scientists analysed 20 years of satellite data and found an increase in carbon , despite ongoing large-scale tropical deforestation in brazil and indonesia , according to research published on monday in nature climate change . carbon flows between the world 's oceans , air and land . it is present in the atmosphere primarily as carbon dioxide ( co2 ) - the main climate-changing gas - and stored as carbon in trees . through photosynthesis , trees convert carbon dioxide into the food they need to grow , locking the carbon in their wood . the greening of earth is thanks to tree-planting in china , forest regrowth in former soviet states because of abandoned farms and more lush savannas because of abandoned farms and higher rainfall . an an image of a family on a farming collective in the ussr in 1935 is shown the researchers say that earth is getting greener thanks to a combination of environmental and financial factors . there are more trees in china because of planting programmes that have been running for a few decades . vegetation has increased on the savannahs of australia , africa and south america as a result of increasing rainfall . russia and former soviet republics have seen the regrowth of forests since huge collective farms have been abandoned . the increase of carbon in the atmosphere over the past decade has caused the ` co2 fertilisation effect ' which has improved the growing conditions for plants a little . as earth gradually warms up and ice and permafrost melts in the arctic , the ` tree line ' is moving north , meaning there are more pine forests springing up . while the four-billion-tonne increase is helpful , it is small compared to the 60 billion tonnes of carbon released into the atmosphere by fossil fuel burning and cement production over the same period , said yi liu , the study 's lead author and a scientist at the university of new south wales . ` from this research , we can see these plants can help absorb some carbon dioxide , but there 's still a lot of carbon dioxide staying in the atmosphere , ' dr liu said by telephone from sydney . ` if we want to stabilise the current level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere - and avoid the consequent impacts - it still requires us to reduce fossil fuel emissions . ' dr liu , who specialises in observing the water cycle , including rainfall and soil moisture , used a new technique of collecting satellite data on radio frequency radiation naturally emitted by the earth to calculate the amount of vegetation in a given area . before , scientists measured vegetation through satellite images and other techniques , looking at canopy greenness and plant height . he had expected to find increased forests in china , which has had tree-planting projects for two to three decades , as well as on abandoned farmland in former soviet countries . china has had tree-planting projects for two to three decades and is now boosting the earth 's greenery , researchers say . here , two giant pandas rest on the outskirts of chengdu in china 's sichuan province but he was surprised to discover the large expansion in vegetation due to higher rainfall on tropical savannas and shrublands in australia , africa and south america . but these fragile gains may be easily lost , as weather patterns shift with climate change , he warned . ` savannas and shrublands are vulnerable to rainfall -- one year can be very wet , and more carbon will be fixed in plants , but the next year can be very dry , and then we will lose the carbon fixed in previous years , ' dr liu explained . louis verchot , a research director at the indonesia-based centre for international forestry research , said dr liu 's findings were ` by and large what we would expect in the warmer and wetter world that results from climate change ' . declines is rainforest vegetation has been particularly dramatic in the amazon and indonesia 's provinces of kalimantan and sumatra . this image shows slash-and-burn agriculture in mozambique researchers found a large expansion in vegetation due to higher rainfall on tropical savannas and shrublands in australia , africa and south america . the savannah , serengeti national park , tanzania pictured over 2,300 square miles ( 6,000 square km ) of amazon rainforest was destroyed in the 12 months to the end of july 2013 , according to statistics from the brazilian government . this means that deforestation was up by 29 per cent and the most activity was seen in the states of para and mato , where more than 390 square miles ( 1,000 square km ) of land was cleared in each location , the bbc reported . before these figures , there was some decline in the clearing of the precious resource to make room for grazing animals and crops . the increase is thought to be because of illegal logging and the building of new infrastructure such as roads and dams , as well as making space for farmers . ` as ice and permafrost melt , they are being replaced by vegetation , and the tree line is moving north as the arctic warms , ' he said by email . vegetation growth is also expected to increase due to rising co2 in the atmosphere , known as the ` co2 fertilisation effect , ` which has improved the growing conditions for plants a little . dr verchot said the value of dr liu 's study is that it puts a number on the contribution of vegetation to moderating greenhouse gas accumulation in the atmosphere . ` hopefully this will lead to greater efforts to stop tropical forest loss and to promote sustainable use of ecosystems in ways that preserve enough of the carbon absorption function as we continue to pump co2 into the atmosphere through fossil fuel burning , ' dr verchot added . declines is rainforest vegetation has been particularly dramatic in the amazon and indonesia 's provinces of kalimantan and sumatra . scientists are particularly alarmed by land clearances in these areas because the forests are richer and more diverse habitats than grassland , for example , and absorb more carbon per hectare than savannah and croplands . while total plant cover may have increased over the past decade , it is arguably of lower quality than that found in rainforests , which also support networks of rare inter-dependent species . the report said that only half of rainforest loss has been offset by growth in other types of forests .
( cnn ) she stood there , injured and holding a knife , outside her florida home . that image is horrifying enough , but nothing compared to what police say they found inside . all three of that woman 's children were unresponsive when officers encountered them friday evening , including a 7-year-old girl who was reported dead soon thereafter , according to the palm bay police department . one of them , a 6-year-old boy , died later . a 5-month-old boy is seriously injured . their mother , identified by police as jessica lacey mccarty , did n't comply to officers ' request that she drop her knife . so officers fired several " less lethal " bean bag rounds at her , after which she was taken into custody , according to police . and on saturday , palm bay police announced on the department 's facebook page that mccarty was being charged with two counts of murder in connection with her children 's deaths . the 33-year-old woman is also facing an attempted murder charge regarding her infant son , who was in critical condition at a nearby hospital . after initially being taken to a hospital after suffering what police called " non-life threatening injuries , " mccarty was moved to the brevard county detention center , where she 's being held without bond . she will face a judge within 24 hours to address the charges , according to the palm bay post from around midday saturday . " a crime like this is beyond words , " police capt. josh resh said . " it is unthinkable that someone could do this to innocent children . " authorities ' first indication of trouble came in a 911 call just before 6 p.m. friday from a woman claiming to have killed her three children . mccarty 's boyfriend -- the father of one of the children -- placed his own call to police seconds later , after arriving home to the grim scene . how and why did the children die ? authorities are waiting on results from an autopsy , scheduled for sunday , to definitively figure that all out . " we are still trying to verify the sequence of events , how and why they occurred , " palm bay police lt. mario augello said . " ... this is still a very active criminal investigation . " regardless , the episode shook those in the victims ' neighborhood in palm bay , which is about 70 miles southeast of orlando on florida 's atlantic coast . it started with the sirens and about 10 armed officers coming down the street , telling him to get inside , neighbor davion lewis cnn affiliate wesh . but for neighbor becky johnson , learning why they had come was even more horrifying . " it 's inexcusable , unthinkable , ... shocking , " johnson said . " you think of your own kids . "

' ` this is one of the simplest ways to protect a child too young to be vaccinated , ' he said . ` thank you for questioning me . i was fortunate to breastfeed my daughter for two years and my son riley for the four weeks of his little life until he had to use a feeding tube in hospital , where i then expressed milk , ' catherine responded . ` i was also vaccinated as a child and received the booster shot three years before his birth , and was told my medical professionals this was sufficient . - riley 's mum . ' the couple , from perth , who set up a facebook page to honour their son riley hughes after he ` passed away peacefully in the arms of his mummy and daddy ' at 2pm on march 17 , aged just 32 days , publicly spoke about their son 's death in the hope it would help prevent more children dying from the preventable disease . riley 's father greg posted a touching tribute on facebook to his ` darling little angel riley ' two days before riley died his mother posted a photo of him wrapped in a blanket in hospital ` our greatest desire out of our own personal tragedy is to stop parents from having to endure the heartache of preventable childhood deaths , ' riley 's dad greg wrote on the facebook page light for riley . catherine hughes has stood up to people who questioned her online the newborn , born on february 13 , died in perth 's princess margaret hospital as a result of pneumonia-based complications arising from whooping cough . the brave family have now raised an incredible $ 36,000 for the princess margaret hospital foundation after setting up a fundraising page in honour of baby riley . greg hughes wrote : ` it was with a mixture of tears and joy that i logged on early this morning to see that we 'd surpassed our initial goal of $ 32,000 ! the last few days have been unbelievably difficult for my family , but this incredible show of humanity has kept us occupied and given us a drive to change the world .

' catherine told mamamia that her whole family is immunised and that they had also asked their friends and families to have boosters . the department of health says it does not know how the child contracted the respiratory disease , also known as pertussis . whooping cough is part of the routine vaccination schedule for babies at two months , four months and six months of age . booster doses are given at 4 years and 10-15 years . infectious diseases expert at anu medical school canberra , sanjaya senanayake , told daily mail australia : ` from my point of view immunisation is wonderful particularly for whooping cough . ' whooping cough ( also known as ` pertussis ' ) is a highly contagious bacterial infection of the lungs and airways . the government health website says the disease is ` highly infectious and most serious in babies under the age of 12 months ' . babies are at greatest risk of infection until they can have at least two doses of the vaccine ( minimum 4 months old ) as the mother 's antibodies do not provide reliable protection . it 's very rare for children who have been immunised against whooping cough to get the disease -- and if they do , it 's usually not as serious . the condition usually begins with a persistent dry and irritating cough that progresses to intense bouts of coughing . these are followed by a distinctive ` whooping ' noise , which is how the condition gets its name . the early symptoms of whooping cough are often similar to those of a common cold and may include : these early symptoms of whooping cough can last for one to two weeks , before becoming more severe . the second stage of whooping cough is often called the paroxysmal stage and is characterised by intense bouts of coughing . each bout of coughing usually lasts between one and two minutes . infants younger than six months may not make the ` whoop ' sound after coughing , but they may start gagging or gasping , and may temporarily stop breathing . the devastated parents have set up a facebook page that already has over 25,000 likes he explained infants are ` at a high risk of dying if they get infected ' and that the death rate from whooping cough in infants under 6 months of age is about 1 per cent . ` it 's important to listen to the experts , ' mr senanayake said . ` whooping cough is lethal in babies and in adults people can be absent from work for the persistent cough , it 's a nasty infection . ' according to the department 's notifiable disease report , there have been 244 cases of whooping cough in wa in the year to date , compared to 292 cases for the corresponding period last year and 232 cases in the first 10 weeks of 2013 . data recorded on immunisation rates across australia on the department of health 's website shows , in 2012 , wa had the lowest vaccination rates for whooping cough and for immunisation overall . in wa 91 per cent of children were immunised against diphtheria , tetanus and pertussis by 12 months of age and 90.2 per cent were fully immunised . in 2013 , the department of health report said that despite a long-standing immunisation program , ` pertussis remains highly prevalent in australia and the least well controlled of all vaccine-preventable diseases ' . ` epidemics occur every 3 to 4 years . in unvaccinated populations , these outbreaks can be very large . in vaccinated populations , outbreaks are smaller , with greatly reduced mortality and morbidity , and may continue to occur every 3 to 4 years or be more widely spaced , ' the report said .
the premier league can easily accommodate an initiative to limit away fans tickets at # 20 to protect the ` spectacle ' of their product , according to the chief executive of the football supporters ' federation kevin miles . chairmen of english football 's 20 elite clubs met in central london on wednesday for the first time since the bumper new # 5.14 billion television broadcasting deal was announced . the fsf presented an open letter to the chairmen , which was co-signed by fan groups from every premier league club , detailing what it believes are key elements to such as the cost of attending live matches , facilities for away fans , more supporter engagement as well a fairer distribution of football 's wealth throughout the domestic game and grassroots . football supporters ' federation campaigners demonstrate outside the meeting of premier league chairmen ticket prices have long been a thorny issue within the modern game , particularly for the away supporters , who often feel they are not being given a fair price especially those of the leading clubs . a recent survey by the fsf showed the likes of arsenal 's top price for visiting supporters was # 64 , qpr charged # 55 while sunderland were cheapest at # 39 . crystal palace charged both home and away fans # 40 at selhurst park . fsf chief executive miles believes making such a gesture would not only show a level of good will to paying customers , but also maintain the unique live atmosphere which makes the premier league such an attractive proposition . the fsf 's chief executive , kevin miles , speaks during the ` share tv wealth ' demonstration ` the uplift on domestic television rights alone , not including the overseas deal , is the equivalent of more than # 40 for every single ticket sold at each game over the three years , so that gives you an idea of how much manoeuvre the clubs have got - and with that much money going into the game , how they could afford to treat people a lot better , ' miles said . ` the premier league has already set one or two precedents , there are already rules to benefit away fans , like how many seats they have to allocate in the stadium and how they can not charge away fans more than the home fans for similar accommodation . ` they also ring-fence money via the " away fans initiative " to be invested into increasing numbers of away fans . ` what we are proposing out of this huge increase in money is they increase the amount of money involved . ' the fsf have argued that away fans should get in to premier league games for # 20 pounds at every ground miles continued : ` our " twenty 's plenty " idea to be implemented , we believe would cost the clubs around # 20million a season , which is # 1million per club , then talk to the fans about how they want that money used , it could make a huge difference to the experience of away support . ` they could make this contribution easily and relatively cheaply , to guarantee the atmosphere with participation of away fans to keep their numbers up , which have declined over the last 10 years and that is something which needs to be addressed . ' miles believes any moves to increase the travelling supporters at all premier league stadia could only have a positive impact . the premier league 's new # 5.1 billion tv rights deal is set to increase the cost of sponsorship ` part of the reason the premier league is able to generate so much money for the television rights is precisely because of the whole atmosphere and spectacle . it would be short-sighted to think it is just all about what happens on the pitch , ' he said . ` the battle is sometimes you have to convince the clubs that it is in their best interest as well as ours , and stress the importance of what fans contribute to what they are selling . ` the premier league did a survey of television audiences in thailand when they were looking at overseas matches , what they found was actually fans did not want to see manchester united against liverpool in bangkok , they would love the chance to go to anfield or old trafford to witness the real thing . ` so there are signs the premier league are starting to look at these things and recognise the importance of it . ' premier league chief executive richard scudamore has spoken about ticket costs in the wake of the deal

ryan lockyer , 22 , ( pictured ) was jailed for six years for the ` terrifying ' attack , which left his 31-year-old victim afraid to go out a woman was forced to jump into a canal to escape a dangerous serial sex attacker who threatened to kill her - but he will not serve a day for the crime . ryan lockyer , 22 , of reading , berkshire , was jailed for six years for the ` terrifying ' attack , which left his 31-year-old victim afraid to go out alone . reading crown court heard the incident took place less than 18 months after lockyer was released early from prison for an earlier series of sex attacks . lockyer stalked his victim , who can not be named for legal reasons , as she walked home from work on october 7 , 2014 . as she passed through a nature reserve near fobney lock in reading , berkshire , at around 3.45 pm , the defendant began following her . when she noticed him he started to run towards her shouting : ' i have a knife and i will kill you . ' prosecutor walton hornsby said lockyer , who was brandishing a 10cms long knife , grabbed the woman and told her : ' i will kill you if you do n't do what i want you to do . ' mr hornsby said : ` she thought the only way to get away from him was to jump in the river . ' the woman then told lockyer she would do whatever he wanted , which appeared to take him by surprise and gave her the chance to slip free from his grasp and jump into the canal . lockyer immediately ran off but the victim remained in the water for some time , scared he was still in the area . the victim eventually returned home and reported the incident to police the following day , describing her attacker as looking like an actor from bbc drama the tudors . lockyer was arrested after being picked out of an identity parade on october 10 and he was charged the next day . he gave a no comment during his interview but at a court hearing on january 7 he admitted a charge of making threats to kill , committing an offence with intent to commit a sexual offence and threatening with a bladed article . reading crown court ( pictured ) heard lockyer carried out the attack less than 18 months after being released early from prison for an earlier series of sex attacks in a victim impact statement the woman described how she now takes the bus everywhere rather than walking alone and sees a potential attacker in every man she encounters . after his arrest lockyer was recalled to prison to serve the rest of his previous licence period . that sentence related to a hearing at oxford crown court in 2011 when , aged 18 years , lockyer was jailed for four years with a three-year licence for sexual assault , three counts of sexual activity with a child and causing actual bodily harm . ` this was , without question , a terrifying experience for your victim , ' judge john told lockyer , who appeared via video link from hmp bullingdon . the judge then blasted parliament for laws which meant he could not jail lockyer for longer than his prison recall for the previous sex attacks , meaning he will ` literally not serve a day ' behind bars for the latest offence . the judge blasted parliament for laws which meant he could not jail the 22-year-old for longer than his prison recall for the previous sex attacks ` that is a consequence which , i feel bound to say , i deplore but about which i can do nothing , ' judge stephen john told lockyer as he sentenced him via video link at reading crown court . judge stephen john described lockyer as ` one of the more dangerous men ' he had come across during his lengthy career , saying it was a ` chilling ' case . judge john said the defendant had an ` alarming ' history and said he was plainly a danger to the public . however , the judge said that because of laws introduced in 2003 and the fact that lockyer would be released halfway through his latest sentence , he would effectively not serve a day behind bars for the canal attack . ` apart from the effect of your recall , you will be entitled to release from the sentence i now impose at the halfway point , thus three years from today , which would be march 9 , 2018 , ' said judge john . ` because of the licence recall , you will not be released until may 13 , 2018 , a mere seven weeks later . ` because parliament in its wisdom chose in 2003 to abolish the power to return a prisoner to custody to serve the unexpired portion of licence and then to order the fresh sentence to run consecutively to that recall , the effect of my order is that you will literally not serve a day longer for the offences for which you are now sentenced . ' when he is released , lockyer will remain on licence for 10 years . in mitigation , peter de feu said : ` as far as this offending goes and this very brave victim , he is sorry . ` he is still young and young enough perhaps for there to be a hope of change . ' lockyer was jailed for six years for making threats to kill and committing an offence with intent to commit a sexual offence . he will serve a two year sentence for threatening with a bladed article concurrently . he was also handed an indefinite sexual offences prevention order , having already been given a 10-year order in 2011 .
an angry mother claims her daughter found a broken security tag lying inside her morning cereals . deena jackson said six-year-old beau had cut her finger on the jagged metal tag as she went to open the box of shredded wheat at their home . the 34-year-old , who bought the nestle cereals from asda in west bridgford , nottingham , said it posed a major choking hazard to her daughter who had initially believed it was a free toy . deena jackson said her six-year-old daughter beau had cut her finger on the jagged metal tag as she went to open the box of shredded wheat both asda and nestle have refused to take responsibility for the dangerous blunder . mrs jackson , who lives in gedling , nottingham , with beau , eight-year-old d'arcy and her husband alex , 45 , said : ` both my daughters thought it was a toy as it 's got moving parts and could swivel . ` the end of the tag is really sharp like a pin , but it 's got a sharp broken wire at the other end too . ` kids thinking it 's a toy are going to be spinning it round and they could get hurt . ` neither asda or nestle are owning up to it , that 's what annoys me . ' the full-time mother said she had called nestle over concerns that such a sharp piece of metal could get past their quality tests . the 34-year-old said it posed a major choking hazard to her daughter who had initially believed it was a free toy ' i just wondered how on earth it had got in there , ' she added . ' i phoned them to express my concerns , but all they seemed to want was the box sent to them , and to reimburse me for the postage and have it forgotten about . ' i refused that initially as i thought it was too dangerous an item to just forget about it and brush it under the carpet . ` it just makes you wonder whether products are being checked thoroughly , especially for things that could be a choking hazard to children . ' but nestle hit back , passing the blame back to asda . a spokesman said the find was ' a security tag that retailers use on high value products . ' he added that all nestle products had to pass through two sets of metal detectors and a security tag would have triggered ` massive alarm bells ' . the security tag , which was broken and sharp like a pin on one side , while the other had a jagged broken wire ` our packing technology is highly automated and we have strict procedures in place including metal detection on the sealed products . ` we are confident that it did not leave out site with that tag in there . ' nestle are now planning to launch an investigation liaising with the retailer . however , asda claimed that the tag had been found in a sealed box and therefore could only have been added in the manufacturing or packing process . a spokesperson for the supermarket , where the cereal was purchased , said : ` we 're at a loss to understand how this happened , as all products are packed and sealed at the manufacturers ' ` we 're happy to assist nestle with their investigation .

' it delves into the clandestine world of israel 's spy agency , the mossad . mossad is using its new cyberwarfare department to track threats and attack iran 's nuclear capacity . the eleventh director of the spy agency , tamir pardo , was determined that israel would not experience an event similar to the attacks on the world trade center in new york in 2001 . this decision came after it was revealed that an intercepted phone message by the american national security agency hinted at the 9/11 attack on the world trade center and the pentagon - but it was caught too late . pardo understood the importance of cyberwarfare after undergoing training at the nsa . he was backed by israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu who told him that their electronic battles against cyberattacks were regarded as israel 's most important defense . meanwhile , iain lobban , the head of britain 's government communication headquarters revealed the country 's ministry of defense was once targeted over 1,000 times a month . he identified the attacks were mostly coming from the tenth bureau , the highly secret department of china 's people liberation army responsible for science and technology . in the united states , general keith b. alexander , the head of the pentagon 's cyber command , confirmed that ` our targets are enemy military command centers that we can reach from cyberspace .

the obama administration has put the brakes on its plans to ban a popular type of rifle ammunition after an onslaught of criticism from both the public and lawmakers . ` you spoke , we listened , ' the agency said tuesday afternoon on twitter . the bureau of alcohol , tobacco , firearms and explosives says the agency received more than 80,000 public comments on the proposal to outlaw some types of 5.56 mm rounds -- also known as .223 caliber ammunition . the agency said tuesday that comments ran overwhelmingly against the proposal , which it first floated in february . the ammunition targeted by the atf is commonly known as ` green-tip ' because of its distinctive appearance . green-tip : the popular rifle ammunition is no longer being targeted for extinction by the atf hunters and target shooters use the bullets , primarily in ar-15-style rifles like this one , but the ammo could travel fast enough from a handgun to pierce a police officer 's body armor uncle : the atf decided tuesday that it could n't withstand an onslaught from legislators and the public ` although atf endeavored to create a proposal that reflected a good faith interpretation of the law and balanced the interests of law enforcement , industry , and sportsmen , the vast majority of the comments received to date are critical of the framework , and include issues that deserve further study , ' the agency said in a press release . ` accordingly , atf will not at this time seek to issue a final framework . ' that carefully parsed language leaves open the possibility that the government could revive the idea in the future . the atf plans to keep collecting comments until march 16 . hundreds of lawmakers , including 52 u.s. senators , also objected . the atf had proposed banning the ammunition , most commonly used in the popular ar-15-style rifles , because they could potentially penetrate a police officer 's protective vest if fired from a handgun instead . the law enforcement officers protection act banned armor-piercing handgun ammunition in 1986 . green-tip ammo has long been exempt because it 's primarily used in hunting and target-shooting rifles . the atf 's proposal would have removed that exemption , effectively banning its sale in the united states . virginia republican rep. bob goodlatte took a rhetorical victory lap on tuesday from his perch as chairman of the house judiciary committee . ` after much pressure from a large , bipartisan majority in the house of representatives , i am pleased that the obama administration has abandoned its attack on the second amendment , ' goodlatte said in a statement . ` it is entirely inappropriate for president obama to stretch his regulatory authority to implement partisan policies that congress has refused to enact , ' he added . ` such an abuse of power would impact many law-abiding gun owners and restrict the american people 's ability to legally and responsibly exercise their second amendment rights . ' last week goodlatte and 238 other house members , including seven democrats , sent a verbal stop sign to the atf . ` under no circumstances should atf adopt a standard that will ban ammunition that is overwhelmingly used by law-abiding americans for legitimate purposes , ' the lawmakers wrote to atf director b. todd jones . on monday a group of 53 republican senators complained in a similar letter to jones that efforts to respect the second amendment to the u.s. constitution -- which protects the ` right to bear arms ' -- ` require not only access to firearms , but to bullets . ' ` if law-abiding gun owners can not obtain rifle ammunition , or face substantial difficulty in finding ammunition available and at reasonable prices because government entities are banning such ammunition , then the second amendment is at risk , ' they claimed . only one gop senator , mark kirk of illinois , chose not to sign the letter . he faces a brutal re-election fight next year in a blue state where gun control advocates have a strong presence . the national rifle association also claimed victory on tuesday . ` vast majority of the comments ... are critical ' : atf 's message to americans admitted that hardly anyone supported them the bureau of alcohol , tobacco , firearms and explosives ( atf ) is a justice department agency in charge of regulating access to a wide variety of materials rifle owners complained that without the green-tip ammo , their guns could become useless overnight ` today 's announcement proves what we have said all along -- this was 100 % political , ' nra executive vice president wayne lapierre said in a statement . ` president obama failed to pass gun control through congress , so he tried impose his political agenda through executive fiat . but every gun owner in america needs to understand barack obama 's hatred of the second amendment has not changed .

a skydiver narrowly avoided death after a double parachute malfunction resulted in him plunging to the ground at around 25mph . the footage captured on the skydiver 's head camera begins with a trio jumping from a plane over perris , california . initially the jump appears to be a success as the skydiver picks up images of the plane , his fellow skydivers dressed in wingsuits and the californian landscape on his camera . so far so good : the skydiver captures his fellow jumpers on their descent over perris , california but suddenly , the bridle , which connects the pilot chute -- a small auxiliary parachute used to deploy the main parachute -- to the deployment bag containing the parachute , wraps around the pilot chute . it then appears that the reserve parachute , which is automatically deployed via an rsl ( reserve static line ) system after cutting away from the main parachute , becomes tangled . this sends the skydiver spiralling out of control , and he begins a dizzying descent back down to earth from a height of more than 1000ft . the skydiver 's reserve parachute , which is automatically deployed via an rsl system after cutting away from the main parachute , becomes tangled the skydiver is sent spiralling out of control and back down to earth at a height of more than 1000ft as he finally reaches the ground it appears that he is descending relatively slowly considering he is without a fully working parachute . but as he slams into the earth with a crunch he groans in pain and shock before attempting to rise to his feet . the man was later taken to the hospital where , remarkably , he was only treated for mild concussion and bruising . writing online after the incident , the skydiver said that he was very lucky to be alive and that some of the people who witnessed the fall expected it to be fatal . the skydiver slams into the earth at a speed of around 25mph and groans in pain and shock the man was taken to the hospital where he was only treated for mild concussion and bruising
nigel owens does a bit of stand-up comedy in his spare time , as well as after-dinner speaking , and one can imagine him being quite funny . the welsh referee , considered among the finest in world rugby , was amusing in his response to being flattened by jimmy cowan a few years ago . ` try going past me next time , ' he remarked , after eventually returning to his feet , even though he knew full well that he , and not the new zealand scrum-half , was at fault . it was entertaining to listen to him this week as he reflected on a hugely impressive performance at twickenham last saturday . welsh referee nigel owens disputes a decision with england captain chris robshaw at twickenham television viewers were struck by the manner in which he handled the players during an extraordinary game that occasionally became bad-tempered . he defused certain situations quite beautifully , even addressing individuals by their full christian names to exert some authority . chris robshaw became ` christopher ' , with owens praising the england skipper and his opposite number for playing some marvellous rugby while ordering them to cut out the nonsense . it worked -- players addressed him as ` sir ' . rugby players generally tend to respect referees rather more than their footballing counterparts but owens , 43 , commands more respect than most . owens commands more respect than many referees when taking charge of top level rugby when he was the victim of homophobic chanting at twickenham last autumn , -- two england fans were fined and banned for abusing owens for being gay -- he received messages of support from players from england as well as australia , new zealand , south africa , france and wales . and when he once asked ronan o'gara to sign a copy of his autobiography for his father , the then ireland fly-half wished geraint owens a happy christmas , but also added how proud he should be of his son . he will go up in the estimation of most for the way he handled a situation only this week . the victim of a homophobic tweet after last weekend 's six nations encounter , owens agreed to travel to carmarthen police station to meet the 18-year-old who had abused him . as part of an agreed adult community resolution -- an alternative way of resolving crimes that allows victims to be involved in deciding how the offender can be dealt with by choosing from a list of out-of-court options -- owens accepted what he described as ` a profound apology ' and let the matter rest . international referee nigel owens jokes around with wrestler barri griffiths on a welsh tv show owens , who does some stand-up comedy in his spare time , appears to enjoy the limelight ` it 's like refereeing a game of rugby , ' owens told me . ` you ca n't referee in black and white . there is an awful lot of grey and you have to apply a bit of common sense . ` this young man was genuinely remorseful for something he accepts was stupid . he apologised to me publicly on twitter and on facebook . ` he could have been left with a criminal record but i saw no point in that on this occasion . the key thing is to get the message out there that it 's not acceptable to insult someone in that way . ` i have learned to handle this kind of abuse . but there will be people out there who are struggling the way i once did and they will find it extremely hurtful . this is about protecting them . ' getting the key decisions right is how a referee is ultimately judged but players seem to like owens ' style . ` until someone said it to me i had n't realised i 'd called robshaw " christopher " , ' he says . ` i suppose you could see it as a device that makes clear to someone you 're not entirely happy with them . it might be the way a teacher addresses a pupil . i did work as a technician at a school for a number of years and also with kids in youth clubs . the 43-year-old directs england and france players during the feisty encounter at twickenham last weekend ` but i 'd probably address most people by their full name until i know them a bit better . ` i learned from derek bevan , a great referee , and i think the secret is to be authoritative , firm and fair but not over-officious . ` if you show the players respect they tend to respect you . and sometimes you can defuse a situation with a smile or a quick bit of wit . that 's probably where comedy comes in handy . i 've been doing stand-up since i was 14 . ' rugby is his first love , but owens follows football too and he takes an interest in some of the issues currently concerning referees in the round-ball game . the crowding of referees is a particular concern , while there is growing pressure for video technology . owens shakes hands with robshaw after last saturday 's six nations clash at twickenham ` i certainly do n't think you can officiate at the top level in rugby without the technology that helps you get the key decisions right , ' he says . ` that 's what we want to achieve across all sports . ` it 's still not perfect . even with a video replay , mistakes can still be made . but it 's definitely something i believe football would benefit from . ` on occasions in rugby it is over-used and we have to guard against that . and football does n't have the natural stoppages that make it a bit easier to call on video technology in rugby . football has more of a natural flow . ` i think something like a captain 's challenge would be interesting ; say one challenge per half per team for the decisions that really matter . ' the welsh referee , who took charge of england vs france last weekend , has done stand-up since he was 14 respect is the other issue ; one , in fairness to football , that the authorities have tried to tackle with different campaigns over the years . ` only if you are very naive would you say football does n't have an issue with respect , ' says owens . ` but rugby should n't take the moral high ground either because i 've seen problems in our sport too . i 've seen referees being pushed in grassroots games and so on . ` ultimately it 's a problem in society , although football has to recognise it can influence how young people behave in society . but i think the laws of rugby allow referees to deal with these kind of issues more effectively . there are more breaks in rugby that enable you to speak to the players . ` referees could also be supported in terms of the citing process . if i make a mistake by giving a player a yellow card when it should have been red , it can be given retrospectively as a red . ` this does n't happen in football , but if players knew that was a possibility -- that the citing process was toughened up -- it would lead to better behaviour on the field .

sky is to increase its prices for sports and family entertainment packages in britain , just six weeks after it agreed to pay a record fee for the rights to show premier league football matches . sky , which normally increases its prices in september , said on thursday the price of a sports tv package would rise by # 1 to # 47 a month . it reflects the balancing act it is attempting after agreeing to pay # 4.2 billion to show 126 live premier league matches a season from 2016 to 2019 , fending off fierce rival bt . sky said upon the announcement of the record premier league deal that it would try to make sure its customers would not have to foot the bill . as of june , it will cost # 47 a month to watch sky sports pundits such as thierry henry ( centre ) sky will no longer have rights to broadcast champions league games from next season sky paid # 4.2 billion to broadcast 126 live games a season from 2016 to 2019 in the premier league ` the company will work hard to minimise the impact of higher rights costs on customers , with the majority of the funding coming through substantial additional savings to be delivered by efficiency plans , ' a sky spokesman said upon the announcement of the rights in february . sky 's family bundle , which includes its highest profile shows and box-sets of drama , would rise by # 3 a month to # 36 . analysts said the lower price rise for sports channels might reflect a concern within the company that viewers could defect to bt , which won the right to show 42 games a season and has also beaten sky to show champions league matches from later this year . the price increases will take effect in june . analysts at citi said this was prudent as the previous timetable would have resulted in sky trying to increase prices just as the champions league matches disappeared from its channels . sky suggested its customers would not have to foot the bill for the record premier league tv deal graphic charts the significant rise of domestic premier league tv revenue seven packages were available in the auction , five with 28 games per season and two with 14 games per season . package a comprises 28 games on saturday lunchtimes ( 12.30 pm ) . package c has 28 games kicking off between 1.30 pm and 2.15 pm on sundays . pack a has 6 ` first pick ' games from 38 rounds and b has 9 first picks . package d is the 4pm sunday bundle of 28 games - crucially with 18 ` first pick ' games . package e is the ` monday night football ' ( 8pm ) bundle , with 18 games on mondays plus 10 on fridays ; this is the first time premier league games will be shown live on friday evenings . there are no first picks in this package . package g is a bundle of 14 games on bank holidays and other sunday matches with two first picks . package b has 28 games at tea-time on saturdays ( 5.30 pm ) packages f has 14 games , a mix of midweek and saturday games including three first picks . under the current ongoing deals sky have paid # 2.28 bn over three years from 2013-16 for 116 games per season , or in other words , get 348 games at # 6,551,724 each . bt have paid # 738m over three years from 2013-16 for 38 games per season , or in other words , get 114 games at # 6,473,684 each . 50 per cent of the revenue is divided equally between the clubs 25 per cent is awarded on a merit basis , determined by final league positions 25 per cent is distributed as a facilities fee for televised matches sky may also have been encouraged to move ahead with price rises now after recent quarterly results showed the number of people leaving the platform had reduced . ` the experience of canal + in france suggests losing rights does not impact subscriber volumes , but does impair pricing power , ' citi said . the analysts said the price rises could result in an around 10 percent increase to earnings per share . shares in sky , which has recently expanded into germany , italy and austria , were up 1.4 percent , outperforming the ftse 100 index which was up 0.4 percent .
nike appears to have missed the mark with its new women 's sportswear collection which many female athletes claim is incredibly insulting because of the overtly girly designs . the iconic sportswear company teamed up with japanese fashion label sacai for the eight-piece nikelab x sacai capsule collection , which the brand debuted last month , but many women were left outraged by the impractical pieces , a majority of which retail for $ 200 or more . ` nike called it a " bold expression of femininity " . in reality , it 's comical and insulting to female athletes everywhere , ' writer megan wiegand said in a piece for slate . female athletics : nike 's collaboration with japanese fashion label sacai resulted in an eight-piece collection featuring billowy tops and pleated skirts not right : critics of the ` feminine ' sportswear line took to social media to air their grievances with the brand 's impractical designs peppy look : this model was snapped running in a sweatsuit from the collection , which features a peplum back she later added : ` the sacai collection is undoubtedly a vanity project for nike , but its premise - that female athletes prize style and appearance over functionality and performance - is completely tone-deaf . ' others have taken to social media to air their grievances with pieces featuring excessive amounts of pleated , billowy fabric that is sure to get in any athletes way - no matter what the activity . ` seriously , that nike women 's line is hideous . women 's athletic wear needs improving , but this is not an improvement . ( sic ) ' one commenter wrote on twitter . new wings : the billowy fabric on these pieces from the line can be seen flowing in the as the model runs forward not a fan : this commenter tweeted that the entire collection was ` horrifying ' party out back : this jacket looks normal in the front but features plenty of pleated fabric from behind bizarre pairing : this royal blue sweatshirt and skirt combination features matching transparent pleats and a hint of hunter green another woman tweeted : ` ew . yeah , that new nike women 's fashion line is a miss . ' someone else joked that the skirt-filled collection : ` looks very practical . ' however , sacai 's founder chitose abe explained on nike 's website that wearability was a significant consideration in her designs . surprise detail : this sweatshirt has a cut-out in the back that showcases a transparent camisole-like top impractical design : this twitter user joked that the nikelab x sacai collection is perfect as long as you are not trying to work out high-tech : the back of this sweatshirt is cut open to reveal a transparent camisole with lace edges , and according to the nike website , the special hem was a new fabric innovation that was specifically developed not a fan : this commenter simply said ` ew ' after seeing the brand 's latest designs proud artist : sacai 's founder chitose abe posed next a model who was wearing her designs for nike ` the idea of functionality is important to me , as is fabric innovation , which has always been at the heart of sacai , ' ms abe said . ` for me , nike is an original icon with performance and innovation at its core . it has been inspiring to work together . ' indeed , ms abe claims that the flamboyant-looking fabrics and over-the-top embellishments on each of the designs has been added in order to enhance the performance of the athlete . the back of one sweatshirt , for example , is cut open to reveal a transparent camisole with lace edges , and according to the nike website , the special hem was a new fabric innovation that was specifically developed by abe and the brand . ` the garments come to life as the wearer walks and moves , expressing both beauty and strength . we feel it 's a perfect marriage between sport and style , ' kurt parker , vp/creative director , nike sportswear , said on the site . pricey sweats : many of the pieces in the collection , including this sweatshirt and skirt , retail for $ 200 or more pants free : this critic joked that the collection 's many pleated skirts looked ` very practical ' interesting accessories : the line 's pleated skirts were paired with fishnet knee high socks that are not for sale odd couple : this simple black nike t-shirt was pairs with this tearaway skirt design and not everyone is disgusted by the collection . when sacai shared photos of the designs on its instagram page earlier this week , many of the label 's fashion fans had positive comments about the collaboration . ` sporty clothes i can get into , ' one person wrote . another commenter wrote : ` love the skirt ! ' not quite right : this looks like a normal sweatshirt dress until you see the extra white fabric and lace detailing that extends from behind added details : a grey sweatshirt from the line features a feminine touch of white peplum in the back new shoes : the nikelab x sacai partnership also debuted a new interpretation of the iconic air max , which turned the classic kicks into a slip-on sneakers
lewis hamilton is determined to ' create history ' again this formula one season after insisting there is more to come despite a perfect start to the new year . reigning world champion hamilton claimed pole , fastest lap and race win in the opening grand prix of the campaign in australia earlier this month . with team-mate nico rosberg second it was abundantly clear mercedes will take some stopping again this term following a dominant 2014 . lewis hamilton poses for a picture with a fan at a meet-and-greet session in kuala lumpur on wednesday hamilton is expected to go head-to-head with mercedes team-mate nico rosberg once more in 2015 hamilton has vowed to create history at mercedes as he bids to win his third world championship mercedes set a new record for victories in a season with 16 from the 19 races , surpassing the prior mark of 15 set by mclaren in 1988 and ferrari in 2002 and again in 2004 . the german manufacturing giant also equalled red bull 's 2011 record of 18 poles for the year , with their only blip in austria where both hamilton and rosberg made errors to let in williams ' felipe massa . the worry for mercedes ' rivals this year is the team appear to have taken a step forward , with hamilton showing no let up in his desire to make it three world titles . ` in terms of my performance i 've got more to come , ' said hamilton ahead of this weekend 's malaysian grand prix . ` i 've been spending time with the engineers and i 'm going to work really hard to understand . ` last year when i went to malaysia i went fresh . it was like my first race of the year . the british driver appeared in relaxed spirits as he sets sights on a third formula one title the mercedes drivers look set to dominate the remainder of the season after setting the pace in australia rosberg and hamilton sign autographs for the dozens mercedes-supporting fans in malaysia ' i went into the race not really knowing how long the tyres would last , but what happened turned out to be exceptional . ` after that race there was this big debrief and a document done to explain everything i did . ` now i 've won in australia i 'm going to extract everything from my data and see how i can better my performance . i definitely feel in this next race i can be better than i was last time out . ' asked of hamilton whether it was mercedes ' target to win every race this season , he replied : ` the target 's always been to win every race , even in the bad days . ` but this year we have an awesome car with improved reliability , so the target is to create history again . ' hamilton won in malaysia last year ahead of mercedes team-mate rosberg hamilton is aware , however , of the potential perils and pitfalls that lie ahead which could scupper such aspirations . ` to pick up where we left off last year was awesome , but if 2014 showed us anything it 's that putting together a whole season is never easy , ' assessed hamilton . ` winning the first race is just one small step in a long journey and i 'm not reading anything into it . ` the next step is malaysia and that 's all i 've been focusing on since we left melbourne . ` the race is really tough with the heat and humidity , but i feel ready for anything right now and the aim is to repeat last year 's performance . ` it took me eight attempts to win this race before i finally made it to the top step last year . i do n't plan on waiting that long again . ` from an outsider 's perspective it appeared hamilton crucially drew first blood in what is expected to be another intense season-long battle with rosberg . hamilton , though , suggested otherwise , stating : ` psychologically it does n't make any difference for me . ' i won the championship again last year , and i felt like it was n't a fluke . i 'm deserving of where i am . ` and i worked damn hard to get that win in australia . again there was n't any luck involved .

vincent kompany was benched by manchester city manager manuel pellegrini for wednesday night 's visit of leicester city . the captain was one of five changes from the side that lost 2-1 at liverpool on sunday . kompany , 28 , has been criticised for a series of high-profile errors . manchester city captain vincent kompany ( right ) was dropped to the bench for the visit of leicester kompany has come in for criticism this season following a number of high-profile errors for the champions he gave away a penalty against arsenal , could have done better with both of barcelona 's goals in a 2-1 champions league defeat and was dispossessed by philippe coutinho in the build up to jordan henderson 's strike for liverpool at anfield . a poll in the local newspaper , the manchester evening news , saw fans vote to drop kompany from the squad . pellegrini has backed the belgian , who he described as ' a great player ' , but rested him for the clash with nigel pearson 's bottom-of-the-table visitors . midfield pair samir nasri and fernandinho dropped out of the squad altogether while pablo zabaleta and edin dzeko were alongside kompany on the bench . wilfried bony , a # 28m signing from swansea city , made his full debut alongside sergio aguero while martin demichelis partnered eliaquim mangala at the heart of defence in place of kompany . man city claimed a 2-0 victory over the foxes courtesy of goals from david silva and james milner . manchester city midfielder fernandinho was dropped from the squad altogether against leicester
( cnn ) entertainers are paid for entertaining and it 's time athletes received financial recompense for taking part in the olympics , says 100m hurdler sally pearson . in 2014 , while the winner of wimbledon received $ 2,600,000 and the augusta masters champion picked up $ 1,620,000 , when pearson won gold in the olympics three years ago she received zero prize money . " people come for the entertainment from the athletes -- we are entertaining them , we are entertainers " the australian , who set an olympic record of 12.48 seconds in her 2012 winning run in 2012 , told cnn anchor alex thomas . " entertainers get paid every single time they step up onto a stage , and that 's exactly what we 're doing in a sporting sense . " billions might have tuned in to watch london 's 2012 olympic games which saw over 10,000 athletes compete across 302 events in a battle for golden glory , but the international olympic committee 's current policy is to ( ioc ) hand out gold , silver and bronze medals as well as a bouquet of flowers to athletes , but no financial remuneration . " i can see why they do n't , and i 'm sure they want to keep it like that , they want to keep it pure , " added pearson . " to be honest we 're all still going to turn up whether we get paid or not . but the games would n't happen without the athletes . " it also would n't happen without sponsors . the ioc has just signed a new eight-year sponsorship deal with car manufacturing giant toyota -- reportedly worth just under $ 1 billion -- adding to their list of partners that include mcdonald 's and coca-cola . athletes usually fund themselves through sponsorship deals , government support , grants and part-time work . in 2012 only half of american track and field athletes -- who were ranked in the top 10 in their nation -- earned more than $ 15,000 a year from their sport . the fifth fastest 100m hurdler in history , pearson told the australia 's daily telegraph in 2013 how a year after her olympic gold medal in london she still was n't attracting enough sponsors . no stranger to hard work -- the hurdler sometimes vomits after intense training sessions -- she decided to chase down her own deals rather than sit on her hands waiting for private sponsorship . while she has some support from qantas , amp and adidas , appearance fees and prize money in the diamond league -- an annual series of track and field meetings -- also provides revenue earning potential for the 28-year-old . now targeting more medal success at the 2016 rio olympics , pearson achieved a resounding win at the queensland track classic on march 7 with a time of 12.74 s. even so the issue of olympic prize money still clearly grates . " i think the times have changed from 1896 to 2016 , i think it might be time to at least have a think about it , and discuss it because there 's no such thing as the olympics without athletics or athletes , " said pearson .

a probe into how police handled child sexual exploitation in rotherham is looking into allegations against 42 officers after complaints were sent to the force watchdog . the independent police complaints commission ( ipcc ) was already examining allegations against ten officers involved in the investigation into one of the country 's most prolific child abuse rings . but today the commission said it had received 30 new complaints containing 100 allegations about 42 officers involved in the rotherham investigation . the independent police complaints commission is examining 100 allegations made against 42 officers from south yorkshire police who investigated child sex abuse in rotherham ( file image ) the complaints came in the wake of the jay report , which described how 1,400 children , mainly girls , were routinely raped , trafficked and groomed in south yorkshire between 1997 and 2013 it said in a statement : ` the complaints contain more than 100 allegations against 42 named police officers , both retired and serving , as well as a number of allegations against officers whose identities are currently unknown . ' the complaints followed on from the jay report , which described how at least 1,400 children were raped , trafficked and groomed in the south yorkshire town between 1997 and 2013 . the ipcc statement said : ` work to establish the identity of the unknown officers and to identify any links between the different complaints and incidents is ongoing . ` the allegations range from neglect of duty by failing to adequately investigate on the basis of intelligence or to deal with incidents appropriately , inappropriate comments and suggestions of corrupt relationships between police officers and offenders . ' the commission said it was also investigating an allegation that south yorkshire police failed to act on information passed to them in 2004 and 2006 about alleged child abuse in nearby sheffield . this complaint relates to two named police officers who are now retired from the police service , the ipcc said . the jay report , published in august last year , sparked furious debate about the tragic crimes which took place in rotherham , and how the perpetrators went unchallenged for so long . the jay report found that the abuse went unchallenged as police and council chiefs were afraid of being labelled racist , as the perpetrators were largely gangs of asian men professor alexis jay , who wrote the report , described how hundreds of vulnerable teenagers , mainly girls , were routinely exploited by gangs of mainly asian men with impunity . police and senior council officers were accused of failing to tackle the problem for fear of being seen as racist , and of ignoring or doubting the victim 's accounts . a wave of high profile resignations followed and the national crime agency was brought in to investigate the crimes and how they were handled . the jay report was followed by another report by louise casey , which was scathing in its criticism of rotherham council and led to the replacement of the local authority 's ruling cabinet with commissioners appointed by communities secretary eric pickles . after more revelations about the scale of exploitation in neighbouring sheffield , the south yorkshire police and crime commissioner , alan billings , last month called for a wide-ranging inspection of his force , along the lines of ms casey 's review of the council 's actions .
( cnn ) let 's just say -- hypothetically -- you found yourself in possession of ecstasy while in ireland on tuesday . everything was cool , because it was n't illegal tuesday . wednesday could be a different story . an appeals court ruling invalidating one section of the misuse of drugs act 1977 made the controlled substances it had regulated legal for at least one day . the independent newspaper of the united kingdom said ecstasy , ketamine and magic mushrooms were three of the temporarily legal drugs . the court of appeal ruled those drugs and others had unconstitutionally been added to section 2 of the law . " we prepared for this possibility . legislation was prepared and approved in advance by cabinet , " minister for health leo varadkar said in a written statement . the government had to get the new legislation through parliament so the drugs added to the law since 1977 could be considered illegal again . it should happen within 24 hours , the department of health said tuesday . drugs such as cannabis , cocaine and heroin remained illegal as did the sale of " psychoactive substances . " the independent said past convictions for some drug offenses will be called into question but the journal of ireland said the court 's decision will impact only cases currently in the judicial process .
( cnn ) they were not-so-affectionately dubbed the " bed-wetters " by then-obama senior adviser david plouffe . the definition : democrats who run to the hills every time there 's a bump in the road . well , they 're at it again . not surprisingly , it 's because of the hillary clinton email brouhaha , an unforced error that is now ricocheting around the political world . and the home team stands in place , just watching , somewhat stunned . but democrats do n't actually have the luxury of standing by and seeing how this all plays out . hillary clinton is their candidate ; their putative nominee . " their only viable plan is to make her the best candidate possible , " says one senior democratic strategist . " and from time to time , this may require an intervention . " now might be a good time . but while the anxious democrats shake their heads about the state of affairs -- and the lack of serious alternatives in the presidential lineup -- they might do well to look at themselves . over the past six years , there 's been a sharp structural decline of elected democrats everywhere below the presidential level . sure , we all know about how the republicans regained control of the senate in 2014 , but what about the fact that blue-state governors fell like tent poles ? or that gop governors now outnumber the democrats by almost two-to-one , 31 to 18 . or that republicans have complete control of nearly three times as many state legislatures as the democrats , 30 to 11 . and down the ballot , democrats under obama have lost more than 900 state legislative seats : the worst showing of any modern president . so , the conventional judgment that the clinton behemoth is just too big -- too well funded , too well supported , too historic -- all helps account for the paucity of alternatives , to be sure . but there 's much , much more to it than the phenom of bigfoot hillary . it 's the phenom of barack obama , too -- and the very strong counterforces he 's generated around the country . the gains at the presidential level have not been cost-free : the country is polarized , the democrats are often on defense and they 're losing ground . one result : a thin presidential bench , which is painfully evident . clinton asks state to release emails : what you need to know and if you take a peek at those blue-state governors who might be president , consider this : at 76 , jerry brown , an able leader , is probably past his sell-by date for a presidential bid . new york gov. andrew cuomo has made very few moves to raise his national profile . and democratic governors are very thin on the ground in the heartland . any time you have republicans winning the gubernatorial races in massachusetts , illinois and maryland , democrats should pay attention . as has been the case with other presidents , for obama party-building has not been on top of the agenda . and so when hillary clinton runs into some trouble , the democrats ought to worry . the republicans have a deep and varied field ; the democrats have one real horse in the race no matter how much she stumbles out of the gate . speaking of hillary clinton , part of the problem right now is situational . those democrats who want to defend her say there 's a problem -- they 're not quite sure what they 're defending , because they 're not sure exactly what happened , or why . in other words , the wagons are circled , but the surrogates are left outside . next , while team clinton may have considered the upside of waiting to announce her candidacy ( why not let the gop battle it out ? no need to give the gop early target practice ? ) , the downside is now obvious : how do you mount a defense with no real or organized apparatus to respond ? if you 're out there making personal appearances , it looks odd to ignore the elephant in the room . no matter how much you tweet about it . clinton 's stumbles fuel democratic critics bottom line , there is no organized pushback and there is no plan b. ( ok , jim webb , martin o'malley and bernie sanders , we know who you are , and that you 're probably running , but still . ) or at least no big plan b . the pre-presidential league on the democratic side is not exactly overflowing with big-time candidates . ( unless you think vice president joe biden is running or secretary of state john kerry is running , which they likely are not . same for massachusetts sen. elizabeth warren . ) so " bed-wetters , " beware . the truth is simple : your job is to defend hillary clinton , not to bury her . yes , it can be hard . but think about it this way : if you do n't , her problems become your own .
church treasurer mark conway-wilcox ( pictured ) has admitted four counts of theft after stealing # 20,000 from st wilfrid 's church 's renovation pot a trusted church treasurer who stole # 20,000 from a renovation pot to fund his gambling habit has narrowly avoided jail . mark conway-wilcox , 30 , of newbiggin hall , newcastle , admitted four counts of theft after stealing from st wilfrid 's church 's - but claimed the amount he had taken was closer to # 15,000 . yesterday he was branded ` unchristian ' for leaving the newcastle church on the brink of closure after stealing the money and blowing it on gambling . newcastle crown court heard conway-wilcox also failed to pay various bills , had creditors chasing the church and even left it potentially uninsured . the court heard conway-wilcox became treasurer at st wilfrid 's in may 2013 and was responsible for making sure money was put in the bank and invoices were paid . after receiving complaints about unpaid bills reverend sarah miller initially gave conway-wilcox the benefit of the doubt . but matters came to a head in may last year when ecclesiastical insurance rang up and told her they had not been paid and that the church and its contents were potentially uninsured . an investigation began and it was discovered conway-wilcox had transferred # 10,098 from the church 's refurbishment account into his own between november 2013 and may 2014 . a further # 550 had been moved from church bank accounts to his account and conway-wilcox failed to bank more than # 10,000 in cheques . prosecutor kevin wardlaw told the court the total amount misappropriated was # 20,856.78 . the church has since been paid back # 10,000 by the insurance company . st wilfrid 's church in newbiggin hall , newcastle , was left in danger of closure after conway-wilcox failed to pay various bills , had creditors chasing the church and even left it potentially uninsured paul caulfield , defending , told the court : ` he had a horrendous gambling problem , referred himself for help and has attended 20 sessions . ` since this matter came to light he has not been involved in gambling . ` he is mortified by his conduct and apologises publicly , having apologised privately previously . ' recorder nicholas lumley qc told conway-wilcox : ` this church serves one of this great city 's less fortunate areas and it has a small but committed congregation . ` the church , its fabric and its good work was placed in jeopardy by you . well , because of your greed . you saw them as a soft target and a ready source of cash for your own frailties and you plundered what money they had . ` you took advantage of your position of trust by stealing from various bank accounts and when it was queried you stalled , prevaricated and lied . ` not only is it unchristian it is thoroughly dishonest . ' newcastle crown court heard conway-wilcox left the newcastle church on the brink of closure martin sheppard , of the diocese of newcastle , said : ` it 's been a very sad story for martin , for his family and the church family at newbiggin hall . it 's been a very difficult time for the congregation . ` we do n't understand why he did what he did . everyone feels great sorrow and regret . ` as i understand it , the money that was taken was money that people had been collecting for the renovation work for a church hall facility in the newbiggin hall area . ` the money was collected by faithful members of the church and now they have been set back in their project to serve the community where they live , work and worship . ' conway-wilcox was handed an eight month prison sentence , suspended for two years , with 200 hours of unpaid work . he was also ordered to pay # 5,000 compensation to st wilfrid 's .
thousands of miles from the playground , real lessons of life and death are played out every day in what 's left of the wild world . this was one such class in kenya 's maasai mara national park , where a lioness taught her cubs how to hunt and kill a wildebeest to stay alive . captured by south african photographer mark dumbleton , the lioness began by circling her prey before her cubs joined the hunt . the animal fought back - but outnumbered and separated from the herd , it was only a matter of time before it was overpowered . mr dumbleton , a wildlife photographer since 2007 , said : ` it was amazing to watch a mother training her children for when they have to leave the pride . ' i could n't believe the animal instinct they had . the lioness was roaring at them , but they knew exactly how to take down such a large animal . ` the whole experience only lasted a couple of minutes . ' red in tooth and claw : deep in the maasai mara , a lioness prepares to teach her children how to hunt circling : captured frame by frame , the animals close in on a wildebeest separated from its herd chase : weighing more than 500lbs when fully-grown , the wildebeest initially managed to evade capture running : the lion cubs pick up on tips they have been taught by their mother and attack from both sides fear : as the rapid-fire sequence unfolds , the wildebeest kicks up dust in its frantic bid to escape weakening : the wildebeest then begins to slow , coming face to face with the animal which wants to take its life teamwork : lionesses hunt in prides , rarely alone , and here the mother closed in to help her cubs overpowered : outnumbered and tired , this was the moment the wildebeest could no longer put up a fight eyeing its prey : the family unit take a look before one of the animals sinks its jaws into the stricken beast killed : lit by the golden evening sun , the wildebeest is dealt a fatal blow by the victorious hunters dinner : wildebeest are strong and fast , but are vulnerable as soon as they are separated from the heard beaten down : south african photographer mark dumbleton said the hunt was over within minutes ' i could n't believe the animal instinct they had , ' he said . ` they knew exactly how to take [ the animal ] down '

a great-grandfather left with a gaping hole in his face due to cancer treatment has been given the devastating news his condition is terminal . raymond martin , 64 , has facial angiosarcoma , a cancer of the inner lining of blood vessels . he has already undergone a series of operations , the first of which took surgeons 12 hours to remove a tumour from his face . but the cancer returned and he required more treatment , as well as procedures to remodel his nose and face . a few months ago he developed a huge wound under his right eye , and doctors planned surgery to remove another tumour . raymond martin , 64 , has been told the cancer that has destroyed his face is incurable and there is nothing more doctors can do . he is pictured before being diagnosed ( left ) and afterwards ( right ) mr martin developed a spot on his face in 2012 , which began to spread . he was diagnosed with facial angiosarcoma , a cancer of the inner lining of blood vessels in 2013 the cancer returned and mr martin developed a gaping hole under his right eye . he is pictured with his family ( from left to right ) , grandson dean martin , 17 , wife alice , 63 and daughter julie martin but surgeons discovered the cancer had spread to such an extent that there is nothing more that can be done . all they can do is help change his bandages and keep him as comfortable as possible . now , mr martin and his family are speaking out to raise awareness of angiosarcoma , in the hope his story can help others . mr martin 's daughter nicola borthwick , 42 , said : ` they 've told us nothing more can be done now . ` we only hope that marty 's story raises awareness and prevents anyone else undergoing what he has had to suffer . ' mr martin is now housebound at his home in scotswood , newcastle , where he is cared for by wife alice , 63 . his problems began when he noticed a spot on his cheek in 2012 , but thought nothing about it . ` it all started with just a spot and it was nothing special so i did n't worry about it , ' mr martin said . ` but the spot started to spread so i went to see a gp and it was first thought that it could be a rash or infection and i was given a course of antibiotics . ' however , the antibiotics did not work and because his face got worse , he was sent to hospital for tests . angiosarcoma is a relatively rare soft tissue tumour . it usually occurs in the head , neck , and especially in the scalp of elderly people . its presentation varies from a small plaque to multifocal nodules . the treatment depends on the extent of the disease , but most cases are treated with wide excision - a surgical procedure to remove a small area of diseased or problematic tissue with a margin of normal tissue - and reconstruction . radiotherapy and chemotherapy are advocated in recurrent or extensive abnormalities in tissue . source : national centre for biotechnology information ` never in a hundred years , could i have imagined that i would be told i had cancer , ' mr martin said . medics at newcastle 's royal victoria infirmary took a skin biopsy from mr martin and experts identified that he had a rare form of cancer that was affecting a large part of his face . there was no other option than to perform a 12-hour-long life-saving surgery to remove the tumour . this involved taking skin from mr martin 's thigh , grafted onto his face . the operation completely changed his appearance . ' i knew that the operation had to be done , so i just had to get on with it , ' he said . ` when i was going home from hospital i thought ' i do n't want to look in the mirror ' . it was a few weeks before i had a proper look at myself and i did get frightened as it looked like i had a bandage on my face . ' following the operation , doctors were optimistic that they had removed the whole tumour and mr martin underwent an intensive course of chemotherapy in the hope of killing any remaining cancer cells . but , just six months later , the facial angiosarcoma returned and once again he required further treatment at the region 's northern centre for cancer care . in 2014 mr martin underwent a 12-hour operation where surgeons removed a cancerous tumour and took skin from his thigh to graft on to his face mr martin is now cared for at his home by his wife alice , 63 . he hopes that through telling his story he will raise awareness to this rare form of cancer after a series of operations to remodel his face and nose , mr martin believed his life was back on track and he could accept his new appearance . but in recent months a wide and painful hole began to develop under his right eye , as the cancer had once again returned . after initially preparing for surgery to remove another tumour , mr martin was dealt the devastating blow that the cancer had spread too rapidly for treatment to be successful . the wound has grown and deteriorated rapidly over recent weeks mr martin 's eyes bleed constantly , and he has to have his bandages changed regularly . his family have rallied around him to support him , and he now hopes , through telling his story , that others will become more aware of angiosarcoma and its devastating effects .
michael o'neill believes his northern ireland side are one win away from turning their euro 2016 dream into a reality . o'neill 's men have been one of the surprise packages of the qualifying campaign , with sunday 's 2-1 defeat of finland making it four wins from five matches . that leaves them second in group f , four points clear of hungary and just a point shy of table-topping romania . michael o'neill ( left ) believes his side are one win away from turning their euro 2016 dream into a reality kyle lafferty of northern ireland blows a kiss to the home support after their euro 2016 qualifying win anghel iordanescu 's side come to windsor park on june 13 and o'neill believes success then would go a long way to ensuring a first major tournament in 30 years . ` the message is simple . we have given ourselves a fantastic chance , and we have to make sure we take our chance again in june , ' he said , after kyle lafferty 's brilliant brace in belfast . ` the romania game becomes massive now . if you can win that game , then it would be hard to think we wo n't get to the euros . it takes on extra significance . do we feel 18 points will be enough ? ` if we can get to 15 points with four games to go , that has to be our target at this moment in time . we will have the chance to go top of the group against romania . ' the game comes at an awkward time , with the english and scottish seasons having broken up for the summer , but o'neill hopes that does not have a major impact . lafferty scores with a header to make the score 2-0 during their win over finland in group f northern ireland are currently second in group f , behind romania , and have 12 points from five games he is relying on dedication from his players and two friendlies - one against qatar on may 31 and another against wales - to get his side in shape . the wales game has yet to be confirmed by the two associations , but o'neill is already treating it as a done deal . we have two good warm-up games before that so preparation will be excellent , ' he said . ` our preparation in june will be vital , and the warm-up games against qatar and wales will be crucial . but players finish their seasons in may , and there is an onus on certain players to maintain their own fitness . ' if fit aaron hughes is sure to become his country 's most capped outfield player in that run of fixtures , with his current tally of 95 leaving him level with david healy . he had to make do with bench duty against finland , with o'neill making the tough choice to pair jonny evans and gareth mcauley in the middle while favouring conor mclaughlin at right-back . o'neill believes a win on june 13 would go a long way to ensuring a first major tournament in 30 years they are second in group f , four points clear of hungary and just a point shy of table-topping romania ` leaving out aaron was maybe the most difficult decision i have had to make in my three years , in terms of team selection , ' the manager confessed . ` everyone knows what aaron hughes is about and what his qualities are as a player and individual . i sat with aaron a few nights ago and talked about his situation at brighton . ` he has n't played much club football in recent tines , and he fully understood where i was coming from . and aaron being aaron , he took it in his professional style . he is still a huge part of this squad , but now we have competition for places which is good . ` jonny ( evans ) showed what a top class player he is , and he showed it at hampden against scotland the other night . ` but it is only a matter of time before aaron gets his 96th cap and goes on to win 100 .

hundreds of sex offenders who are supposed to be closely monitored have been missing for up to 14 years - but police have refused to name dozens in case they breach their ` human rights ' . police forces across britain have lost track of 396 registered sex offenders , including rapists and paedophiles , but they wo n't be identified in case it ` endangers their safety unnecessarily ' , one force said . the sex attackers are meant to be kept under close surveillance after being released from jail because many pose a ` risk of serious harm to the public ' . scotland yard , the uk 's largest force , has lost track of 167 sex offenders , including one who had been missing for 14 years but figures released yesterday found that some have been missing for more than a decade . there are 23 from greater manchester are among the almost 400 missing nationally and police believe 11 have fled abroad and the other 12 are subject to ` periodic reviews ' in a bid to trace them . but the force said today it would not name them to protect their rights . a spokesman said : ` it is not the policy of gmp or the police service of england and wales to routinely name sex offenders whether they are missing or not as this would be a breach of their human rights . this also may endanger their safety unnecessarily and may also lead to the identification of victims . ' scotland yard , the uk 's largest force , has lost track of 167 sex offenders , including one who had been missing for 14 years . among the missing is failed asylum seeker patrick mosekwe kanda , 36 , who was jailed in 1998 for raping a child . when the congolese national was released in 2003 he was allowed to live at an address in dagenham , east london , instead of being deported . sara payne , whose daughter sarah was abducted and killed in 2000 by convicted paedophile roy whiting , said : ` it 's completely unacceptable that any registered sex offenders have disappeared from authority management , putting the public at risk ' like other dangerous predators , kanda was placed on the sex offenders register and was supposed to be monitored by police and probation officials . but scotland yard last month admitted it had lost track of the rapist two years ago and issued an appeal for information relating to his whereabouts . a spokesman for the met force blamed london 's ` diverse multicultural population ' for losing so many sex offenders and admitted that many have probably fled the country . last night sara payne , whose daughter sarah was abducted and killed in 2000 by convicted paedophile roy whiting , said : ` it 's completely unacceptable that any registered sex offenders have disappeared from authority management , putting the public at risk . ` it 's time to take some serious pro-active action to bring them back under the police radar . ' the nspcc described the figures as ` alarming ' and said there are 900 police staff currently responsible for monitoring 46,000 registered sex offenders . this equates to one officer being tasked with monitoring 51 sex criminals . jon brown , the nspcc 's head of sexual abuse programmes , said : ` about half of those on the register are offenders who have raped or sexually assaulted children , or committed online child abuse image offences . however most just receive one police visit a year after they have been released from prison . ` the monitoring of registered sex offenders in communities needs urgent attention by the government to ensure it is fit for purpose . ' ` it seems this area is currently chronically under resourced and the number of dangerous individuals on the register is increasing yearly . ' claude knights , chief executive of children 's charity kidscape , added : ` we know that sex offenders are at their most volatile and dangerous when they are living in chaotic and unsettled circumstances . ` registered sex offenders who are of no fixed abode are very difficult to assess and monitor , and most importantly are not complying with notification requirements . ` the safety of our communities depends on predators being on the appropriate radars . we have a duty of care to potential victims . ' protection : greater manchester police ( headquarters pictured ) said today it would not name the missing sex offenders ` as this would be a breach of their human rights ' the figures emerged from freedom of information requests submitted to all police forces in britain . one convicted sex offender from gloucestershire has been missing since the year 2000 , another in northumbria disappeared in may 2002 . meanwhile humberside police said the whereabouts of one registered sex offender has remained a mystery since september 2004 . west midlands police said 39 registered sex offenders were missing , including one since 2006 and nine who have disappeared between 2010 and 2012 . in manchester , police have lost track of 25 sex attackers , including one who disappeared in september 2005 and three others who went missing in 2006 . both essex and sussex police forces said 11 registered sex offenders are missing from their respective areas , while cambridgeshire police said it has lost track of 10 on their list . a home office spokesman said : ` the uk has some of the toughest powers in the world to deal with sex offenders and we are committed to ensuring the system is as robust as possible . ` it is for the police to manage offenders in their area , but we work closely with forces to ensure legislation is effective and that officers have all the tools they need .

' ` australia 's plain packaging laws banned tobacco company branding from packaging and replaced it with upsetting photos such as the toe tag on a corpse , the cancerous mouth , the nightmarish eyeball or the diseased lung , ' he said . ` perhaps unsurprisingly , since this law was implemented total consumption of tobacco and cigarettes in australia fell to record lows ... and nightmares about eyeballs have risen to record highs .

england 's plans for the calcutta cup showdown with scotland have been undermined by yet another midfield injury -- as brad barritt limped out of saracens ' win at wasps on sunday . in the 58th minute of the aviva premiership encounter , the 28-year-old was contesting a high kick but landed awkwardly and his right leg bent backwards as home fly-half andy goode landed on it . he was treated on the field before being helped off . initial indications were that barritt had suffered a medial ligament strain in his knee , but that early prognosis soon changed . brad barritt , hopeful of an england return against scotland , limped out of saracens ' win at wasps on sunday barritt 's injury after andy goode landed on his leg initially seemed to be to his knee , but was to his ankle after his side 's 26-17 comeback win , saracens ' director of rugby , mark mccall , said : ` it seems to be his ankle . the knee seems to be okay . we 're all hopeful it wo n't be too serious . ` it did n't look very good and brad has been unlucky this season . i 'm sure he 'll be close to selection for england next weekend , so fingers crossed it 's not as bad as it looked . ' barritt was due to join up with the rest of the england squad at their surrey hq on sunday night and he will face urgent medical assessments on monday , as the coaches wait to discover if he will be available for saturday 's rbs six nations clash with the scots at twickenham . with luther burrell of northampton unable to train last week due to a calf strain , barritt was seemingly destined for a recall at inside centre , but now his hopes hang in the balance . saracens ' director of rugby mark mccall is hoping barritt 's injury is n't as bad as it looked barritt ( obscured by goode ) was penalised for this challenge on goode in the air that caused the injury barritt was due for a recall to the england side as northampton 's luther burrell struggles with a calf strain the saracen was an heroic mainstay of england 's autumn victory over australia in his last test appearance , but a calf injury in that game kept him out for a month , then he damaged knee ligaments in his clubs ' european champions cup tie against clermont auvergne in france . that untimely setback meant barritt was unable to retain the national no 12 shirt , as he surely would have done if he had come through that pre-championship weekend unscathed . stuart lancaster , england 's head coach , will hope that if barritt is n't cleared for a return against scotland , burrell does recover in time . the alternative option would be to pick billy twelvetrees at inside centre , but the gloucester captain 's form has been alarmingly inconsistent this season . if barritt is fit to play , he is set to rejoin the back line along with harlequins full-back mike brown -- despite alex goode 's superb efforts at no 10 for saracens yesterday . up front , northampton lock courtney lawes is expected to come into the second row in place of george kruis . england coach stuart lancaster 's plans for saturday 's calcutta cup clash may have to be rethought barritt , here tackling wasps ' nathan hughes , will undergo urgent medical examinations on monday unlucky barritt has recently recovered from calf and knee ligament injuries before the most recent blow
suspended : dr adam osborne ( pictured ) was suspended by the gmc two weeks ago amid sex with patient allegations , and has now stepped down as director of the company he owns with his wife the psychiatrist brother of chancellor george osborne has resigned from his private medical company , leaving it with assets of just # 551 . dr adam osborne , 38 , was suspended by the general medical council two weeks ago pending an investigation into allegations he had a two-year sexual affair with a vulnerable woman patient -- a married mother of two with psychiatric issues . now he has stepped down as a director of elitemed , the private company he co-owns with his wife rahala noor , a plastic surgeon . the company recently filed accounts which showed it was worth just # 551 , had # 71 in the bank and owed creditors # 7,337 . documents also revealed rahala noor , 37 , who was previously secretary of the company , took over as the sole director . the couple each own 50 per cent of the company , but gmc rules mean osborne can not practise as a doctor until an investigation into the allegations is concluded . if they are upheld he could be struck off , although the gmc says the current suspension is not an indication of guilt . another firm called devonport psychiatry , which was registered to osborne 's west london home , appears to have had its 0845 number disconnected since the mail on sunday revealed he had been suspended by the gmc . he has also taken down his personal website . elitemed was set up in 2010 shortly after osborne was suspended over earlier claims which centred on his relationship with a cocaine-addicted prostitute . at the time , the gmc said his ` relationship ' with the woman had ` clouded his judgment ' and led him to prescribe anti-psychotic drugs , dishonestly use a false name and fail to inform her gp . the doctor was also disciplined for prescribing contraceptive pills to rahala -- who was then his girlfriend -- and an anti-smoking drug to a family member . osborne married noor in a muslim ceremony in 2009 after he had converted to islam and changed his first name to mohammed . a news report about his conversion was last year hidden by google after a request from an unknown person following a controversial ` right to be forgotten ' ruling in the european court of justice . this gave people the right to have ` no longer relevant ' items removed from internet searches . probe : george osborne 's brother can not practise as a doctor until the investigation is concluded osborne is the youngest brother of the chancellor and one of four sons born to sir peter osborne -- who co-founded wallpaper company osborne & little . after studying medicine at manchester university , he became a junior doctor at the city 's wythenshawe hospital , a job he was forced to quit after the allegations of handing out falsified prescriptions . he went on to practise as a private psychiatrist in marylebone , central london .
jonny evans ' wife , helen , had to leap to the defence of the manchester united defender in a rather awkward phone-in conversation with celebrity arsenal fan piers morgan . mrs evans , a presenter on the club 's mutv channel , dealt with the rather unwanted and uncomfortable call on thursday night while sat alongside former red devils defender david may . as she previewed united 's fa cup sixth-round tie at home to arsenal , morgan shifted the conversation on to her husband 's ` spitgate ' ( a term used by morgan ) incident with newcastle striker papiss cisse last week . helen evans has defended her husband , jonny , during a phone-in conversation with piers morgan evans , a presenter on manchester united 's tv channel mutv , spoke to the celebrity arsenal fan on thursday jonny evans ( left ) appears to launch spit in the direction of the newcastle 's papiss cisse , who then retaliates evans and cisse clashed near the halfway line at st james ' park following the unpleasant exchange manchester united defender evans received a six-match ban from the fa after the ugly incident tempers threatened to boil over as team-mates from newcastle and united gathered following the incident arsenal ( h ) march 9 , fa cup * ; tottenham ( h ) march 15 liverpool ( a ) march 22 aston villa ( h ) april 4 man city ( h ) april 12 chelsea ( a ) april 18 ( * possible replay or fa cup semi-final could mean he is available for the chelsea game ) a disciplinary panel ruled that evans and newcastle rival cisse had spat at each other in an incident missed by referee anthony taylor during the st james ' park clash . cisse was banned for seven games ( he was given an extra match as it was a second suspension of the season ) by the football association , while evans was handed a six-match ban - despite fiercely denying the charge . and the 27-year-old 's wife reiterated his stance when morgan quizzed her over his innocence . ` that 's definitely the case [ he had no idea about the spitting incident ] , he did n't even know that he had got spat back at until after the game when he had watched the footage , ' she told morgan . ` people can believe what they want but that 's the truth . ` jonny spat on the floor and it was obviously near [ papiss ] cisse so unfortunately it was just the way that the camera looked at it and saw it and also the way that cisse saw it , but what can you do . ' evans , nee mcconnell , met the defender shortly after she landed her dream job for the club 's official tv channel . there is no right of appeal so evans will not be able to contest the decision by the three-man panel the couple started dating shortly after in 2011 and got married two years later at clough presbyterian church in county antrim , northern ireland . last year they became parents for the first time following the birth of baby lottie in may . her husband 's ban , which starts against the gunners on monday , could see him miss the fa cup semi-final in april should united overcome their north london rivals . however , morgan feels louis van gaal 's cup run will end at old trafford before boldly predicting a comfortable win for the visitors and more disciplinary problems for the red devils in a tongue-in-cheek comment . ` it 's my usual confident prediction 5-0 arsenal , [ olivier ] giroud hat-trick , ' he added on mutv . ` i 'm also predicting at least three members of united 's team to be sent off for spitting . ' as well as quizzing mrs evans , morgan boldly predicted a 5-0 win for his beloved arsenal on monday night piers morgan : ` have you got any comments about spitgate ? ' helen evans : ` now i thought you might start with that one . no comments to make everything is in the statement piers , i do n't need to anything else . ' pm : ' i was just curious whether that helen who knows jonny [ evans ] , obviously better than the rest of us , that when he says he had absolutely no idea he had even be seen spitting whether she thought that was the case ? he : ` that 's definitely the case [ he had no idea about the spitting incident ] , he did n't even know that he had got spat back at until after the game when he had watched the footage , ' she told morgan . people can believe what they want but that 's the truth . ' pm : ' i certainly believe you but what i wonder , when you see the footage back , if you were [ papiss ] cisse and you watch that video back you could see why he felt that he been deliberately spat on , right ? ' he : ` oh yeah . jonny spat on the floor and it was obviously near cisse so unfortunately it was just the way that the camera looked at it and saw it and also the way that cisse saw it , but what can you do . ' he : ` thanks for talking to us tonight . ' pm : ` well you have n't asked me for my prediction yet . ' he : ` yes go for it . ' pm : ` it 's my usual confident prediction 5-0 arsenal , [ olivier ] giroud hat-trick . he : ` well we 're predicting 8-2 ! ' pm : ` i 'm also predicting at least three members of united 's team to be sent off for spitting . '
a bus driver who claims to have eaten over 500 takeaways a year for 20 years has given up his habit to shed a whopping six stone . mark gadsby , from ashbourne , derbyshire , fed his addiction by tucking into indian , chinese and fish-and-chip takeaways at least once a day - and then binning the food packages to hide the evidence . but the 33-year-old ditched the convenience food and 20 years after being bullied as a teenager , he has shed six stone . mark was eating takeaways everyday , left , before he joined slimming world and lost six stone , right mark , who works for a coach company , said : ` i 'm utterly ashamed of what i was like . i would love to be able to ask myself what i was doing to myself before . ' i just see a massive fat person when i 'm looking at old photos . i think , ` what an earth was i doing to myself ? ' i was not eating all day when i was big - it was only at night . it was all about convenience food and the amount i ate was huge . ' i would always call at mcdonald 's after work , or a chippy or takeaway . ' i would always top that up with convenience food like hot pasties and sausage rolls from bakeries and fast-food places . ` from the age of 10 to 32 that pattern would continue and that 's when i was really big . i was eating about 500 takeaways a year , which over that period of time is 10,000 . mark , pictured before the weight loss , would always stop in at mcdonald 's or a chippy after work mark suffered emotionally because of his weight and was a target of cruel bullies who made his life a misery ` having all of that food , often late at night , gave me terrible indigestion and made me feel ill . it was constant greggs and subway and it would be every day . ' mark said he suffered emotionally because of his weight and was a target of cruel bullies who made his life a misery . he said : ` there was a group of girls who would refer to me as man boobs - it was very hurtful . the bullying really hurt and made me feel worse than i did before . ' as mark is a bus driver , he felt like he had to get his food quickly and on the go . he said : ' i would use a drive-through quite a bit because i could go straight through and i did n't need to get out . ' i would hide the food packaging because i did n't want people to know . i was like an alcoholic craving booze . ' mark moved in with his mother about two years ago and a combination of the slimming world diet plan and his mum 's cooking has meant the weight has dropped off . he said : ` she helps me a great deal and it 's brilliant to be back . she keeps me on track and there 's no sneaking food now . ` everything is freshly prepared and there 's nowhere near the same amount of takeaways as before . ' mark now hopes to be able to use his own experiences to help other people in their battle with weight as a slimming world consultant . mark , pictured above , has been put in slimming world 's hall of fame as ` slimmer of the month ' mark no longer sneaks food and says that all of his meals are freshly prepared thanks to his mum 's cooking
museums give a snapshot of the past but their static displays struggle to truly emulate what it would have been like to live in an ancient era . now an archaeologist is hoping to merge the present with the past using augmented reality to make people feel as if they have travelled back in time . the dead men 's eyes app puts virtual buildings on top of real world images , and his dead men 's nose bag emits odours to make the environment smell like it would have done in the past . the dead men 's eyes prototype was developed by dr stuart eve from university college london . it uses augmented reality to lay virtual images onto the real world ( virtual huts are shown on the site of a prehistoric settlement on leskernick hill , cornwall ) . the setup uses the camera on an ipad and an augmented reality app the prototype applications and hardware were developed by dr stuart eve , an honorary research associate at the institute of archaeology university college london ( ucl ) and a member of l - p : archaeology . dead men 's eye uses an ipad 's gps to pinpoint the user 's location . when they hold the ipad 's camera up to the landscape , virtual reconstructions are placed on top of the real world images . these reconstructions move and change in real-time as the user moves around the terrain . it uses a mixture of the unity3d gaming engine and vuforia 's augmented reality technology to place the virtual layers in their correct location and perspective - taken from archaeological data - based on where the user is stood . ` augmented reality enables us to give glimpses into the past - that are not possible if you are just walking around a site or indeed part of a city of a rural field in the middle of nowhere , ' dr eve told mailonline . ` these ` experiences ' could be easily recreated within a virtual reality environment , by donning an oculus rift and some vr gloves we can see and touch the past . during the bronze age the site on bodmin moor was a tin-mining village . when dr eve held the camera up to the hill ( left ) a series of huts appeared to make it look like he was exploring the ancient village ( right ) . these reconstructions move and change in real-time as the user moves around the terrain to make this experience more immersive , the archaeologist also developed the dead men 's nose ( shown being worn by dr eve ) . it can emit specific smells and these could include the smell of barbecues wafting through a virtual scene , or the bag could feature smells of woodsmoke and manure ` however , by creating the whole experience within a computer and then donning a pair of closed goggles - we run the risk of cutting ourselves off from the real world - and creating bands of zombies plugged into computers who never have any experience of the real world and instead choose to live within a virtual world - with all interactions mediated through a computer . ' dead men 's eye uses an ipad 's gps to pinpoint the user 's location . when they hold the ipad 's camera up to the landscape virtual reconstructions are placed on top of the real world images . these reconstructions move and change in real-time as the user moves around the terrain . it uses a mixture of the unity3d gaming engine and vuforia 's augmented reality technology to place the virtual layers in their correct location and perspective -- taken from archaeological data -- based on where the user is stood . the dead man 's nose is a prototype of a smell delivery device that wafts smells to the user 's nose based on their location . the hardware is built using an arduino microcontroller and computer parts and can be used with any scent of the user 's choice . software-wise , the device connects to a webserver and ` fires off ' smells when connected to the unity3d technology , for example . consequently the smells are released at the correct time and location as the user explores . in one example dr eve used his technology on the side of leskernick hill , in the middle of bodmin moor in cornwall . during the bronze age the site was a tin-mining village . when dr eve held the camera up to the hill a series of huts appear to make it look like he 's exploring the prehistoric settlement . ` seeing a reconstruction of the village that can be physically explored when you are standing in the real location is a visceral experience and , for me , comes pretty close to a time machine , ' added dr eve . to make this experience more immersive , dr eve has also developed the dead men 's nose bag . the devices can either be placed around the landscape to emit specific smells , or worn by the user as they explore the augmented world . for example , the smell of barbecues could be wafted through scene or a bag could feature smells of woodsmoke and manure . ` the dead man 's nose is a very early prototype of a smell delivery device that wafts certain smells gently into your nose based on your location , ' said dr eve . the hardware uses an arduino microcontroller with standard computer parts and can be used with any scent of the user 's choice . software-wise , the device connects to a webserver and ` fires off ' smells when connected to the unity3d technology , for example . the dead men 's nose hardware ( prototype shown ) uses an arduino microcontroller with standard computer parts and can be used with any scent of the user 's choice . software-wise , the device connects to a webserver and ` fires off ' smells when connected to the unity3d technology , for example in a similar project , the museum of london 's streetmuseum app lets people walk side-by-side with londoners from the 19th and 20th century . the app recognises a user 's location and overlays the historic image over the current view - augmenting the reality that the smartphone camera perceives in february last year the museum of london updated its streetmuseum app to let people walk side-by-side with londoners from the 19th and 20th century . for those using the app on the move , the app recognises their location and overlays the historic image over the current view - augmenting the reality that the smartphone camera perceives . each historic photograph was taken by a renowned photographer , including henry grant , wolfgang suschitsky , roger mayne and george davison reid . there are more than 100 locations and images ranging from 1868 to 2003 . consequently the smells can be released at the correct time and location as the user explores . ` technological development is moving at an incredible rate , and already it is possible to wear transparent glasses with forward-facing cameras to overlay the ar information directly onto your field of vision , rather than having to use a portable handheld device such as a mobile telephone ' continued dr eve . ` as this develops further , this will go some way towards mitigating the disconnectedness of having to hold up a mobile device in order to experience the virtual objects . ' the name of the prototypes was taken from the montague rhodes james ' short story , ` dead men 's eyes ( a view from a hill ) ' . in the story , character mr fanshawe discovers a pair of field glasses and when he looks through them , he sees the past . ` it is really exciting stuff and the technology is in its infancy - but as with any new thing - it has to be carefully led in the right way , otherwise it will just end us up in some dystopic future where we get things beamed directly to our brains ! ' in february last year the museum of london updated its streetmuseum app to let people walk side-by-side with londoners from the 19th and 20th century . for those using the app on the move , the app recognises their location and overlays the historic image over the current view - augmenting the reality that the smartphone camera perceives .
a brave transgender teenager came out in front of his entire class . tom sosnik , 13 , of fresno , california , first read the suicide note written by leelah alcorn , another tragic teen who took her own life at the end of last year . he then told the students ; ' i am no longer mia . i never really was . ' tom sosnik ( above ) came out as transgender to his class sosnik ( above ) told his fellow students ; ' i am not mia . sosnik ( above with glee star lauren potter ) when he was mia the middle school student then said ; ` and now i finally stand before you in my true and authentic gender identity as tom . i stand before you as a 13-year-old boy . ' tom then detailed his struggle over the past few years , and what it took to bring him to the moment where he made this announcement . he eloquently explained his challenges , saying ; ` for a while , i dismissed the fact that i hated my body . i pretended to be content with what i was assigned until , at a certain point , i broke . ' sosnik began his speech by reading the tragic suicide note of leelah alcorn ( above ) he then added ; ' i went through a series of horrible breakdowns . and i would stand under the water in the shower crying . i knew i was n't happy . ' he also took some time to let other students know if they were struggling with their sexual identity or orientation , he was there for them . ' i want you to know that if no one else accepts you , i always will , ' he said . if you are reading this , it means that i have committed suicide and obviously failed to delete this post from my queue . please do n't be sad , it 's for the better . the life i would 've lived is n't worth living in ... because i 'm transgender . i could go into detail explaining why i feel that way , but this note is probably going to be lengthy enough as it is . to put it simply , i feel like a girl trapped in a boy 's body , and i 've felt that way ever since i was 4 . i never knew there was a word for that feeling , nor was it possible for a boy to become a girl , so i never told anyone and i just continued to do traditionally ` boyish ' things to try to fit in . when i was 14 , i learned what transgender meant and cried of happiness . after 10 years of confusion i finally understood who i was . i immediately told my mom , and she reacted extremely negatively , telling me that it was a phase , that i would never truly be a girl , that god does n't make mistakes , that i am wrong . if you are reading this , parents , please do n't tell this to your kids . even if you are christian or are against transgender people do n't ever say that to someone , especially your kid . that wo n't do anything but make them hate them self . that 's exactly what it did to me . my mom started taking me to a therapist , but would only take me to christian therapists , ( who were all very biased ) so i never actually got the therapy i needed to cure me of my depression . i only got more christians telling me that i was selfish and wrong and that i should look to god for help . when i was 16 i realized that my parents would never come around , and that i would have to wait until i was 18 to start any sort of transitioning treatment , which absolutely broke my heart . the longer you wait , the harder it is to transition . i felt hopeless , that i was just going to look like a man in drag for the rest of my life . on my 16th birthday , when i did n't receive consent from my parents to start transitioning , i cried myself to sleep . i formed a sort of a ` f *** you ' attitude towards my parents and came out as gay at school , thinking that maybe if i eased into coming out as trans it would be less of a shock . although the reaction from my friends was positive , my parents were pissed . they felt like i was attacking their image , and that i was an embarrassment to them . they wanted me to be their perfect little straight christian boy , and that 's obviously not what i wanted . so they took me out of public school , took away my laptop and phone , and forbid me of getting on any sort of social media , completely isolating me from my friends . this was probably the part of my life when i was the most depressed , and i 'm surprised i did n't kill myself . i was completely alone for 5 months . no friends , no support , no love . just my parent 's disappointment and the cruelty of loneliness . at the end of the school year , my parents finally came around and gave me my phone and let me back on social media . i was excited , i finally had my friends back . they were extremely excited to see me and talk to me , but only at first . eventually they realized they did n't actually give a s ** t about me , and i felt even lonelier than i did before . the only friends i thought i had only liked me because they saw me five times a week . after a summer of having almost no friends plus the weight of having to think about college , save money for moving out , keep my grades up , go to church each week and feel like s ** t because everyone there is against everything i live for , i have decided i 've had enough . i 'm never going to transition successfully , even when i move out . i 'm never going to be happy with the way i look or sound . i 'm never going to have enough friends to satisfy me . i 'm never going to have enough love to satisfy me . i 'm never going to find a man who loves me . i 'm never going to be happy . either i live the rest of my life as a lonely man who wishes he were a woman or i live my life as a lonelier woman who hates herself . there 's no way out . i 'm sad enough already , i do n't need my life to get any worse . people say ` it gets better ' but that is n't true in my case . each day i get worse . that 's the gist of it , that 's why i feel like killing myself . sorry if that 's not a good enough reason for you , it 's good enough for me . as for my will , i want 100 % of the things that i legally own to be sold and the money ( plus my money in the bank ) to be given to trans civil rights movements and support groups , i do n't give a s ** t which one . the only way i will rest in peace is if one day transgender people are n't treated the way i was , they 're treated like humans , with valid feelings and human rights . gender needs to be taught about in schools , the earlier the better . my death needs to mean something . my death needs to be counted in the number of transgender people who commit suicide this year . i want someone to look at that number and say ` that 's f *** ed up ' and fix it .

` what do women want ' is such a common question that it inspired a hollywood movie starring mel gibson . and the feminist writer julie burchill reckons that female sexuality has been suppressed and controlled for so long that they no longer have any idea what they want . in an article for the new issue of loaded magazine , the columnist details the hypocrisies and strict demands that modern women demand of their boyfriends and husbands . julie burchill ( pictured ) believes that many women are unsure of what they want from a man because they have been controlled for so long julie told the publication : ` what [ men ] generally fear is women will want them for the wrong things . ` it 's women who are thought to be the soppy sex , but they are capable of great hard-headedness in matters of what is laughably known as the heart . ' she continued : ` most women want a man who makes them laugh , sadly , they often do n't see this goes two ways and men need to have fun as much as they do . ` some women want a man to tick all the boxes -- handsome , rich , great job -- but would be outraged if men subjected them to a similar shopping list . ' julie burchill points out that some women claim to be too tired to have sex , but have enough energy to go out drinking with their friends ( picture posed by models ) ms burchill , who is an ardent supporter of the female sex , revealed to the publication that one thing some women most definitely do not want is sex . she said : ' i know from personal experience that women tend to become sexually impervious to their husbands far more often and earlier than husbands do to their wives , ` you 'd think if a woman wanted to relax , or have a nice bit of me time , she could easily opt for a good old roll-around . ` but a lot of women are n't interested in sex without making it into a huge performance number -- they want romance . ' in many relationships , women lose interest in sex much quicker than the man ( picture posed by models ) she continued : ` we 've all heard about those broads in relationships who mysteriously stop shagging their significant other , claiming they " have n't got time for sex " and , " i 'm too tired " . ` how come they 're never too tired to get trashed on rosé wine with their mates on a friday night , go to the garden centre early on a saturday morning and spend every weekday on mumsnet ? ' she continued : ` maybe sex would n't take so long and be so tiring if they did n't demand the ring cycle equivalent of romance first ? ' the new issue of loaded magazine but the writer is n't taking a pop at women , in fact , far from it . she believes that the reason they are so conflicted in their desires is that they have been controlled as a sex for so long that their needs have desires have become muddled . she said : ` the way female sexuality has been corralled and controlled over the centuries would leave any poor s * d confused . ` because of the disparity of opportunity and pay in the workplace for so long , women found the easiest way to advance themselves was through a man , and so the trapping and keeping of a husband become something most women put above all else . ` it takes a long time to heal from such strange and prolonged distortion of the self -- hence the phenomenon of broads insisting they are " strong women " while buying books in which the sole point is the heroine being dominated by the hero . ` this historical injury explains why it 's still so hard , often , for men to understand what women want . ' i do n't even know . ' the new issue of loaded is out now

a man who has not been in italy is always conscious of an inferiority , from not having seen what it is expected a man should see . so said samuel johnson , who was forever ready with a suitable aphorism . suitable , that is , if you were living in the 18th century , when the rich and titled minority wafted around florence and rome as part of their grand tour , allowing travel to broaden their minds before bringing back new ideas to influence our architecture , landscape and gardening . the cities they visited overflowed with statues and art , some of which they bought on the cheap , or pinched when the italians were looking the other way . though tuscany can sometimes seem overcrowded , it 's still possible to return with plenty of treasured memories ( pictured : san gimignano and its towers ) johnson would be surprised to see how popular italian cities have become nowadays : visitors are well advised to arrive outside the summer peak when sightseeing can be hard ( and sometimes positively dangerous given the rise of the selfie-stick -- the ultimate stupidity of modern - day tourism ) . e. m. forster took a wry look at the early days of mass tourism to italy at the end of the 19th century in a room with a view . when the young heroine lucy honeychurch finds herself in the church of santa croce without her baedeker guidebook , forster is expressing the horror of the intellectual at the worrying rise of the ` uneducated ' tourist . he went so far as to wonder whether there ought to be some sort of intelligence test imposed at dover to weed out the truly stupid traveller . but today 's tourists do n't come to tuscany so much to learn as to ` experience ' . the treasures of the uffizi or an up-close sight of david in florence 's accademia gallery are stirring in their own right -- you do n't really need to know their place in the history of renaissance art in order to enjoy them . chianciano terme was called fontes clusinae by the romans , and they made use of its thermal springs in florence you can assimilate the art and savour it , just as you might imbibe a glass of fine italian wine . the problem is that at busy times , it 's hard to find the space to enjoy either the art or the wine . but though tuscany can sometimes seem overcrowded , it 's still possible to return with plenty of treasured memories . mine are of a pleasant three-star hotel in a place named chianciano terme , about 50 miles south-east of siena , which was our base . the romans called it fontes clusinae , and made use of its thermal springs , as visitors still do . i have good memories , too , of the tuscan landscape , with its well-tended fields and vineyards , its olive groves and cypress trees . i like being in a countryside that has not been neglected , or turned into a theme park for townies . in this regard , tuscany is rewarding . the ` chianti classico ' area , which lies between florence and siena , still looks much as it was when it was painted by the great renaissance artists who assumed that the holy land must have looked a lot like tuscany -- so this is what you see in the background of various scenes of holy birth and crucifixion . as you pass through this land , you enjoy divine views across glorious sprawling vineyards ; a view occasionally interrupted by stunningly picturesque castles . writer john carter 's tour leader called tuscany 's sam gimignano ' a medieval manhattan ' of course , other countries have beautiful landscapes , but few can match tuscany for its sublime , gentle sweetness . leonardo was born in the small town of vinci which lies in this magnificent scenery -- a final confirmation that the area is touched by genius . we ate well , naturally , and drank moderately well , too . some of my fellow travellers discovered a red wine named nobile di montepulciano , which they found most acceptable . our base was just five miles or so from montepulciano , so supplies were guaranteed . we went to san gimignano , which our tour leader called ` a medieval manhattan ' -- and it was n't the first time i 'd heard it described that way , unfortunately . its towers are most impressive , though it seems to take a greater pride in its ice cream . we liked san gimignano , mainly because there were n't so many people , but also because we were left to our own devices and could make up our own minds about the place without being told all sorts of stuff by a local guide . i 'm in two minds about local guides . they do tell you lots of useful things , but have a tendency to tell you too much , so everything blurs . travelsphere ( travelsphere.co.uk , 0800 987 5110 ) offers and eight-day treasures of tuscany tour with prices starting from # 604 . this includes return flights from gatwick , transfers , half-board , accommodation , transport and some excursions . florence provided a good example of this . the guide there told us about artists and sculptors and architects and the ruling families of medieval times . she gave the names of the buildings and their histories . and dates ; masses of dates . at the end of it all , i was most confused . but the guide never mentioned the florence that might have made english visitors prick up their ears . indeed , she had never even heard of florence nightingale who was born in that city and was given its name . the nightingale family had a penchant for strange first names : florence 's elder sister parthenope was called after an ancient name for naples , where the family was living at the time of her birth . i suppose that both girls were glad that at the time of their births , the family had not been living in croydon ...
a british backpacker who wrote a romantic note to locate a handsome stranger after spotting him on a new zealand beach has finally met her romeo for the first time . sarah milne , from glasgow , left a handmade poster for the man , who she saw in picton on friday and described as ` shirtless , wearing black shorts with stars tattooed on his torso and running with a curly , bouncy and blonde dog ' . in her note , entitled ` is this you ? ' , she invited the mystery stranger to meet her on the same beach on tuesday . but the message soon became a source of huge online interest with the identity of both the author and its intended target generating unexpected publicity . then on tuesday at 2pm , in front of a gathering crowd waiting to see the two finally introduce themselves , william scott chalmers came forward to meet the note 's author , milne , an artist , on the picturesque foreshore . milne , who is originally from the west coast of scotland , studied at glasgow school of arts before backpacking in new zealand where she will stay for another two months . she said that she had not been expecting the hype surrounding her handwritten note . sarah milne , a backpacker from scotland , meets william chalmers , after her note brought them together they finally meet : mr chalmers met milne just after 2pm and asked if she wanted to go somewhere quiet and have a drink love note : the handmade message milne used to launch a public appeal to find a man after a brief encounter on friday mr chalmers , who brought a bottle of champagne with him , walked over to where milne was sitting and said ` hello , i 'm william , you know you could have just asked for my number . ' ` let 's go somewhere and have a drink away from everyone , ' he told her , as the crowd watching their date clapped and cheered . mr chalmers came forward on sunday morning to reveal himself as the mystery man , and told daily mail australia that he planned on heading down to the picturesque spot to ask his brunette admirer on a date for the evening . the new zealander , who works at a local burger joint , said that he first heard of the poster when his housemate came home at 3am on saturday night and woke him up . ` he was carrying on and telling me about a poster that two german girls had told him about that described me , ' he said . ` he knew it was me because i 'm the only guy in picton who has star tattoos , johnny-bravo hair and a labradoodle . ' mr chalmers said he and his housemate drove down to the shore in the dark to try and find the note , and that even when he saw it for himself , he had a hard time believing it was real . milne was greeted at the picturesque meeting spot with great fanfare after their story had generated huge publicity the glasgow artist was greeted as she stepped off her ferry to a sign that said ` here 's to a happy ending ' . ` of course i 'm going down . but just going up to her and asking to chat is a bit out of the question with all the attention , so i 'm just going to have to skip a step and ask if she wants to have dinner tonight , ' mr chalmers told daily mail australia . ' i finish work at 2pm and i 'll see if she wants to have dinner or a drink at maybe seven . ` i 'm not sure if the poor girl knows what she 's gotten herself into . it 's just gotten so big , i 've gotten messages from friends overseas saying that they 've read the story . ' the poster in question was tied to a pole down at the shorefront and was also posted on beachcomber fun cruises facebook page on saturday . ' i was sitting on the grass on friday watching the sea ... you were playing with your dog . you ran past me and smiled , ' it said . ` would you like to go for a drink/coffee/walk ??? i 'm in wellington just now , my ferry arrives back in picton on tuesday 3rd . ` i 'm in town for 1 night only ... but let 's see how things go ... on the off-chance you are single , remember who i am and would like to meet for a drink/coffee/walk . mr chalmers has revealed himself as the mystery man who captured the heart of the mystery woman he said he was looking forward to tuesday and meeting his mystery girl ` i 'll be sitting on the grass , watching the sea from 1-1 .30 pm onwards on tuesday ... maybe you 'll run past again ?!? ' mr chalmers said his mother had called him because she had been told of the sign and thought it was such a coincidence that the man described in the sign had star tattoos as well . ` when i told her that it was me , she started freaking out and telling everyone in the office , ' he said . ` she 's all for me going down . she told me that she did n't raise me to not show up , so that 's what i 'm going to do . ` it 's a bit overwhelming , i 've never had something like this happen before . in high school if you passed a note the teacher would just take it off you . ' mr chalmers said while he did not know who the woman was , he remembered smiling at a particular woman that day on the beach . ` it 's all a bit exciting , it 's going to be a big day , ' he said . the signs were posted on beachcomber fun cruises facebook page and has sparked an online debate ` picton is a pretty small town and from the amount of people who have told me they 're going to come down and watch what happens it sounds like everyone i know will be there . ' milne may have had some inkling of the stir the note has caused , pleading with the public to not have the sign removed from the premises . ` in the spirit of happy endings , give this sign a chance to be seen by the right eyes , ' she penned . ` it may even bring a dozen or so people back on tuesday , intrigued ... who is this girl with the long brown hair and the boy with the star tattoos and the dog and will they meet for a drink ? ' i will , on my return to picton on tuesday , remove it myself ... whatever the ending may be . mr chalmers promised he would keep the fascinated followers of the real-life fairytale up to date with the outcome of their evening .

' southee spoke of a sporting rivalry with australia in which new zealand was always ` the little brother . ' he was asked directly at a news conference on friday whether sunday 's final was about winning the respect of a fierce sporting rival whose attitude to new zealand cricket has always contained a note of condescension . new zealand batsman kane williamson practices his football skills during the training session in melbourne new zealand captain brendon mccullum in the nets just outside the melbourne cricket ground grant elliott has a throw at the stumps in a fielding drill during new zealand 's practice session southee allowed that there had been cause in the past for australia to view new zealand in that manner . ` in times gone by we have n't played to our potential or been as consistent as we should have been , ' he said . ` in the last two years we 've slowly , slowly gained a bit more respect because of the brand of cricket we 're playing . ` we respect australia , they 're a quality side and they 're not no 1 in the world for no reason . but i 'm sure we 've gained a bit of repsect for the brand of cricket we 've played over the last couple of years . i guess that opinion has changed a little bit over the last couple of years in the way that we 've played and because of the sides we 've beaten .

( cnn ) for over two decades , bassist mike porcaro was a rock star with the band toto , playing venues around the world . now , the music world is mourning the death of porcaro , who died after a battle with lou gehrig 's disease , also known as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or als . " our brother mike passed away peacefully in his sleep at 12:04 am last night at home surrounded by his family , " porcaro 's brother steve , the band 's keyboardist , posted on facebook on sunday . " rest in peace , my brother , " about 10 years ago , porcaro started noticing weakness in his fingers and hands . he was diagnosed with the disease in 2006 . former members of his band -- known for hits such as " africa " and " rosanna " -- rallied to help . they reunited for a brief european tour in 2010 in support of porcaro . toto vocalist and guitarist steve lukather also called porcaro a brother . " my brother mike porcaro is now now at peace , " he tweeted . " i will miss him more than i could ever put into words . my deepest love to the family . als is a fast-moving , usually fatal disease of the nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord . it affects more than 30,000 people at any given time .
( cnn ) you 're late for your flight , sweaty from having dragged your luggage to the check-in counter , and stressed about making it through security before boarding begins . for some of us , this is the rule , not the exception . for most of us , it 's a pretty unremarkable scenario . not so fast , says the transportation security administration . typical airport behavior like this could make you a suspicious traveler who should be subjected to questioning and additional screening -- and possibly referred to the police for investigation , detention or arrest . that should seem far-fetched , but it is n't . the tsa continues to use pseudo-scientific " behavior detection " techniques that have given rise to persistent allegations of racial and ethnic profiling at our nation 's airports . through a program called screening passengers by observation techniques , or spot , the tsa employs thousands of " behavior detection officers " who scrutinize travelers to look for signs of " mal-intent " in airport screening areas . the officers typically spend less than 30 seconds scanning an average passenger for over 90 behaviors the tsa associates with stress , fear or deception . when the officers perceive clusters of such behaviors in any given individual , they refer that person for secondary inspection and questioning . the spot program relies on theories about " micro-expressions , " involuntary facial expressions that supposedly appear for milliseconds despite one 's efforts to conceal them . behavior detection officers look for such micro-expressions while scanning passengers ' faces or engaging in casual conversation with them . it 's as nutty as it sounds . setting aside that the officers ' perception of these behaviors is inherently subjective , there 's just no evidence that deception or " mal-intent " can reliably be detected through observation , especially in an unstructured setting like an airport screening area . the fact that many people find such settings inherently stressful only compounds the problem . if tsa 's behavior detection officers look for stress in a stressful environment , they 're going to find it , along with plenty of false positives . just about everyone outside the tsa who has reviewed the spot program has decided that it 's unscientific and a waste of money . an exhaustive review by the government accountability office found the spot program lacked a scientific basis , that the behavioral indicators it relied on were subjective , and that the tsa had no effective means to test its effectiveness . in no uncertain terms , the gao recommended that congress curtail funding for the program . an independent scientific advisory group that reviewed the spot program also concluded that " no scientific evidence exists to support the detection or inference of future behavior , including intent . " and during a congressional hearing on the program , republican rep. richard hudson of north carolina observed , " to my knowledge , there has not been a single instance where a behavior detection officer has referred someone to a law enforcement officer and that individual turned out to be a terrorist . " rep. michael mccaul of texas , the republican chairman of the house homeland security committee , stated , " i am concerned that tsa will continue to spin its wheels with this program instead of developing a more effective and efficient approach . " despite this withering criticism , spot remains in place and has cost taxpayers well over $ 1 billion ( that 's with a b ) since its inception in 2007 . repeat : over a billion dollars on a misguided program that does n't work . equally troubling is that spot has given rise to persistent allegations of racial and ethnic profiling -- an unfortunately inevitable result when law enforcement or border agents single people out based on hasty , gut-level judgments about them . allegations of profiling by behavior detection officers have come not only from travelers , but also from numerous other officers . over 30 behavior detection officers at boston logan international airport said that profiling was rampant there . one of the officers told reporters , " they just pull aside anyone who they do n't like the way they look -- if they are black and have expensive clothes or jewelry , or if they are hispanic . " another officer submitted an anonymous complaint saying , " the behavior detection program is no longer a behavior-based program , but it is a racial profiling program .

order and progress -- ordem e progresso -- read the brazilian flags adorning the stands at the emirates on sunday , and the samba stars have certainly made some decent headway since their unceremonious exit from their home world cup eight months ago . make no mistake , this was no vintage selecao showing . there was little of the free-flowing football we have come to expect from brazil . head coach dunga , himself a world cup-winning defensive midfielder , has implemented a defence-first policy , with long balls up to the strikers very much the order of the day as far as attacking play was concerned . firmino celebrates after scoring the opening goal during the friendly match between brazil and chile firmino is congratulated by teammates after scoring the opening goal during the match at emirates stadium neymar was in the wars again after this foul on the touchline left the barcelona star in apparent agony but brazil , missing david luiz , dante and maicon from the back four who started the 7-1 humiliation against germany , looked a vastly more robust outfit defensively . thiago silva , so sorely missed in that ill-fated semi-final , was an assured presence at the heart of the back line , while centre-back partner miranda weighed in with impressive physicality -- especially in dealing with the driving force and trickery of alexis sanchez . brazil are the pioneers of the attacking full back , but much-coveted porto defender danilo , despite his excellent through-ball for fermino 's opener , was relatively reserved on the right side of defence . danilo ( right ) springs into an acrobatic challenge to try and win back possession for his side from sanchez left back marcelo , perhaps a surprising inclusion given his culpability in belo horizonte , was also uncharacteristically disciplined , but still offered support to neymar and philippe coutinho when the situation called for it . sitting midfielders souza and fernandinho -- the latter being the only other survivor from the world cup semi-final -- were effective in protecting the back four and took their clear pre-match objective to kick lumps out of sanchez very seriously . though the manchester city man rode his luck a few too many times in dangerous positions . where dunga 's men really struggled to deal with chile 's high-pressing game was in attacking midfield . coutinho and douglas costa were hassled and harried by their opponents ' packed midfield on the rare occasions they maintained possession , and as a result created very little for their forwards , who were often forced to drop deep to influence the game . brazil forward luiz adriano struggles to keep his balance as medel challenges his opponent for possession barcelona star neymar keeps his eye on the ball as he tries to control and begin another attack barcelona star neymar is evidently in pain after medel 's cynical stamp at the emirates stadium on sunday predictably , neymar drew the majority of attention -- both from his baying supporters and his on-pitch adversaries -- and he was by far brazil 's biggest threat in attack . his lively play in a free role was vital to ensure they did n't stagnate at the business end of the pitch and his ability to occupy multiple defenders was invaluable to his side . strike partner luiz adriano , on the other hand , was ineffectual . with the creativity of coutinho and costa stifled , the shakhtar man saw very little of the ball and appeared disinterested in forcing the issue . neymar has all eyes on the ball against chile midfielder medel at the emirates stadium on sunday real madrid left back marcelo attempts to clear the ball under pressure from vidal during the friendly brazil manager dunga passes on instructions to his right back danilo as he watches his side take on chile arsenal forward sanchez sprints away from thiago silva ( left ) on the emirates stadium pitch firmino skips past the on-coming claudio bravo on 72 minutes to slot brazil ahead at the emirates stadium his replacement , firmino , showed impressive composure in scoring brazil 's winner , and his intelligent movement was a definite upgrade . though at that stage , jorge sampaoli 's men were looking leggy after 72 minutes of dogged pressing , and firmino exploited this . on the whole , we witnessed a complete change in brazil 's philosophy since the world cup , which is not necessarily a bad thing . their gung-ho approach dictated by passionate home support was perhaps their biggest downfall last summer . a lengthy mexican wave in the first half told the story of brazil 's performance , but in sacrificing an emphasis on attack dunga looks to have addressed brazil 's major defensive defects . attacking cohesion will have to wait .
( cnn ) history has repeated itself at indian wells with the surprise withdrawal of serena williams from the semifinal due to a knee injury . williams ' withdrawal comes 14 years after her sister venus pulled out minutes before the semifinal in 2001 -- also with a knee injury -- a move which led to a tournament boycott , amid claims of racism , that only ended this year . williams had been due to play romanian simona halep on friday night , but instead posted news of her withdrawal on instagram . " four months ago i began a journey to play indian wells and it was amazing . i never dreamed i could do it . but i would not have been able to do this without my fans . though it ended early due to injury this year , i have to say i can not wait to try again next year . i love you so much ! " back in 2001 , crowds booed a young serena as she took on belgian kim clijsters in the final of the competition now known as the bnp paribas open . despite being on home soil , spectators backed clijsters in scenes former tennis champion and broadcaster pam shriver said were difficult to watch . " you would expect the crowd to be so supportive of the u.s. player , so it clearly was the exact opposite . because she was american , because she was so young , because she was african-american , predominantly white audience . it was tough , it was tough to listen to , " shriver told cnn 's open court . shriver watched as spectators booed serena 's father richard and sister venus , as they walked down the steps to take their seats for the match . " that 's when we realized this crowd is still really upset by what happened in the semifinals , " shriver said . minutes before the highly-anticipated semifinal between the two sisters , venus pulled out due to a knee injury . her withdrawal seemed to add credence to rumors , which the family denies , that the result of the match had been pre-determined by their father , who kept a tight control on his daughters ' careers . despite the booing , williams beat clijsters to take the title . but the issue did not end there . days later , richard williams gave a press conference and said the booing amounted to racial abuse , bill dwyre , who covered the match for l.a. times told open court . " richard williams had said that the n-word had been used and that the booing was racially motivated . ... that was the beginning of serena never coming back . " after 14 years of refusing to play at indian wells , serena williams , who with her sister has dominated the world rankings for more than a decade , said that she was " following her heart " by deciding to rejoin the tournament . " in order to forgive you have to be able to really let go of everything , " she told reporters at a pre-match news conference . serena said she discussed it with her father in a " really emotional " conversation and he agreed . " he said it would be a big mistake if i did n't go back and i thought that was really admirable , " williams said . before the match , she told reporters that , by returning , she felt like she 'd already won . " i do n't think i need to hold the trophy at the end of it . i feel like i 'm already holding the trophy . i 've never felt that way before , " she said . " just being here is a huge win not only for me but for so many people and it 's a wonderful feeling . " williams ' early exit gives halep a free pass to the final .

the astana cycling team have denied reports they have been stripped of their worldtour licence by the independent licence commission . last month the uci requested that astana 's licence be revoked by the commission following an independent audit into the team of 2014 tour de france winner vincenzo nibali , which came after a number of anti-doping infringements by astana and their feeder team . on monday , dutch newspaper de telegraaf reported that astana would lose their worldtour licence and would only be allowed to apply for a continental licence , the third tier of professional cycling , saying the decision had been made on march 20 . the astana cycling team have denied reports they have been stripped of their worldtour licence the licence commission is due to meet with astana on thursday , and the team said they believed that meeting would mark the start of the decision-making process , with no verdict yet in place . an astana statement said : ` astana pro team has every reason to believe that our meeting on april 2 with the independent licence commission will be a properly conducted legal meeting with due process and is not a foregone conclusion . ` we aim to present evidence that astana pro team is in full compliance with the ethical codes in place and is taking pro-active measures to enhance our role in the global fight against drugs in cycling .

if you 're of the opinion that text speak and emojis are making us lazy and ruining language , you may want to look away now . a developer has created the ultimate predictive text app called lazyboard that provides a list of just ten commonly used words , and 11 emoticons . users can combine these prepopulated words to create messages quickly and simply without having to type a single letter . lazyboard was created by reddit user sir-zeph and it lets people communicate using a list of just ten commonly used words ( pictured ) including ` cool ' , ` nice ' , ` damn ' , ` oh ' , ` thks ' ` lol ' and ` lel ' the free app is available for phones running android 4.2 and above , and words include ` cool ' , ` nice ' , ` damn ' , ` oh ' , ` thks ' ` lol ' and ` lel ' . lazyboard was uploaded to the google play store by developer prem adithya , listed as reddit user sir-zeph . its description says : ` feeling lazy ? not in the mood for a proper conversation ? well the only thing you need is the lazyboard . ` it is a minimalistic keyboard that has the important keys required to have a lazy conversation . ' the lazyboard comes with two themes - dark and light - that can be configured in the app settings menu , and sir-zeph wrote on reddit that a pro version is ` coming soon ' that will have more themes . the lazyboard comes with two themes - dark and light - that can be configured in the app settings menu and lets people choose from 11 set emoticons . a pro version is ` coming soon ' that will have more themes it is the latest in a long line of apps and products designed to tap into the growing trend of people replacing conversations with acronyms , emojis and shortcuts . last month , for example , developers created a keyboard cover that turns every key of a mac board into an emoji . once installed , the caps lock key lets users switch between regular and emoji keys meaning people can easily add images to facebook posts , tweets and even official documents . the emoji keyboard and its custom software were developed by a team of designers at california-based disk cactus . the emoji keyboard and its custom software were recently developed by a team of designers at california-based disk cactus . once installed , the caps lock key lets users switch between regular and the emoji keys meaning people can easily add the small images to facebook posts , tweets and even official documents each of the covers are made of silicone and act like standard covers to block out dust and dirt . they come in two sizes - one for standard macs , which includes the 13-inch and 15-inch macbook pro , the macbook air 13 and the apple wireless mac keyboard ( pictured ) , and one for the 11-inch macbook air the team has set up a kickstarter campaign to fund production of at least 1,000 covers , but hopes to be able to mass produce them by the end of the year . and last year a pair of london-based developers created the emojli app that only let users communicate using the popular miniature images . even usernames have to be comprised of a selection of emoticons . and with the release of ios 8 apple allowed app developers to create emoji-based keyboards for iphones , ipads and iphones . a study in april last year found that the top trending word , at that time , was emoji . there are now apps dedicated to the small images . emojli , for example , ( pictured ) only lets users communicate using the popular pictures , and even usernames have to be comprised of a selection of emoticons emoji were originally popular in japan , and widely used online . however , in recent years they have become hugely popular elsewhere . originally meaning pictograph , the word emoji literally means ` picture ' ( e ) + ` letter ' ( moji ) . are standardised and include some specific to japanese culture , such as a bowing ( apologising ) businessman , a face wearing a face mask , a white flower used to denote ` brilliant homework ' or a group of emoji representing popular foods : ramen noodles , dango , onigiri , japanese emoji character sets have been incorporated into unicode , allowing them to be used elsewhere including websites and apps such as facebook and twitter .
switzerland star xherdan shaqiri says roberto mancini was the reason he decided to swap bayern munich for inter milan . shaqiri struggled to secure a regular starting place in his three years at bayern munich and made the move to the san siro in january after speaking with mancini . the 23-year-old had offers to move to spain and england but opted for inter and hopes to repay the faith shown in him by mancini . xherdan shaqiri says he moved to inter milan to get more game time shaqiri helped inter get passed celtic in the europa league speaking in la gazzetta dello sport , he said : ` inter had been in contact with my agents and my brother erdin for some time . ` then there were two phone calls from mancini . we had two good chats . i immediately felt like i would be very important for him . ` at my age , what interested me most was the chance to play regularly , which had n't happened a lot lately . shaqiri says he turned down offers from england and spain to join inter shaqiri spoke to inter manager roberto mancini and he swayed him to move to the san siro ` mancini explained to me that i would see a lot of time on the pitch . he spoke about his philosophy and that of the club , and his desire to take inter back to its glorious recent past . ' inter travel to napoli on sunday and will look to get back to winning ways after defeat by fiorentina last week , but shaqiri knows it will not be an easy game . he added : ` it is not easy to win at napoli , but getting three points there would be very important psychologically . we must play well and try to grow . we have everything it takes to do that .

jordan wills works as a paintball target , with colleagues firing paintballs at him at close range when student jordan wills goes to work he must prepared to pelted by bullets , fired at him at close range and at speeds of almost 40mph . the 19-year-old from london works as a human bullet impact tester , or more simply a paintball target , and every week faces the pellets being fired at his torso to test how hard they are on impact or how large a welt they leave . he beat more than 10,000 other applicants from around the world to land the # 16,000 a year job as a tester and fits in being used for target practice around his university studies . ' i guess i have a high pain tolerance - but it 's really not as painful as people think , ' said the kingston university computer graphics student . ` the hardest part is the anticipation when you know it 's coming . ` the most times i 'd be shot at during a shift is ten over a course of an hour or two . ' and while most people playing paintball will wear some form of protective clothing , mr wills does his job in just a t-shirt . he is a fan of the game anyway , and has previously played a lot in his spare time . he works 16 hours a week at different uk paintball sites across the country on a pro-rata salary of # 40,000 , which works out at a wage of around # 16,000 a year . mr wills , who stays in shape as a rower , said despite the welts and the occasional pain he loves his job . he added : ` when people find out what i do they think i 'm crazy - but i love my job . ` the initial pain lasts for about five seconds , then it stings for maybe ten seconds - and then it 's gone . i do n't even remember i 've been shot . ' the teenager wears protective goggles to cover his eyes - but trusts his well-trained colleagues to steer clear of other vulnerable body parts and stop when he tells them to . the paintballs are fired at jordan 's torso at close range - between 25 and 30 feet by a professional shooter at a speed of almost 40mph . rather than take the usual approach of fleeing the oncoming paintballs , mr wills must stand still while players take aim at him . he reports back on the impact of the paintballs so that manufacturers can ensure new batches are not too hard . anything that draws blood , leaves too serious a mark or does not explode on impact is unacceptable . mr wills was selected for the role out of 10,000 other applicants because of his knowledge of paintball the 19-year-old often suffers welts on his body from the impact which take three or four days to disappear the practice leaves him with welts over his body , but the student said he barely notices . ` sometimes i take a hot bath after a shift , but mostly i just forget they 're even there , ' he added . ` at first my girlfriend did n't like it , but now she 's cool with it . the marks take about four days to fade . ' i think i got the job because i knew about paintballing already . i worked for three years marshalling games - so i was well aware of what it felt like to be hit . ' i love paintballing and knew about the different types of paints and the ins and outs of the guns . ` people tell me i must be an idiot but it 's only people who do n't know enough about paintball . when you 're in the middle of a game you 're running around and having so much fun you hardly notice when you 're hit . the teenager does his job wearing just a t-shirt , and endures balls being fired at him at very close range as part of the role mr wills must stand still and resist the urge , as happens in actual games , to run away ' i work two days a week and my hours are flexible . ' i have great colleagues and get to work outside and have a bit of fun . what 's not to like ? ' justin toohig , uk paintball owner and the student 's boss , said : ` jordan 's a great guy . he 's up for a laugh , has a fantastic attitude and fits in well with the crew - that 's mainly what we were looking for . ` he can take the bullets like a man and does n't whinge at all . he 's athletic and knew about paintball . ` we still ca n't believe how many applicants we got . emails were coming in from all over the world - new ones were popping up faster than we could file them . ` maybe it 's a sign of the economy , or simply because people love paintball . mr wells insists he does n't really feel pain from the impact of paintballs being fired at him at close range mr wills said he does not mind being hit or the resulting welts and thinks he has a high threshold for pain ` in the end we interviewed 18 guys and jordan got the job . ` we 're very careful and would never put jordan at risk . ` safety is extremely important to us - that 's why we needed a tester in the first place . what jordan is doing is the extreme . it 's done in a controlled environment and we 're testing for worst-case scenario . ` we 'd never recommend for anyone to emulate it on the playing field or at home . ' when the job was advertised last year mr toohig was quoted as saying : ` we want to hear from people with a high pain threshold and those to whom fear is a foreign concept . '
katie hopkins has been reported to police by labour mp simon danczuk over claims she incited racial hatred in tweets linking pakistani men to the rochdale child sex abuse scandal katie hopkins has been reported to police by labour mp simon danczuk over claims she incited racial hatred in tweets linking pakistani men to the rochdale child sex abuse scandal . mr danczuk , who represents the town , has asked the police commissioner of greater manchester police , tony lloyd , to investigate whether a crime had been committed after comments made by the outspoken tv star on twitter . hopkins sent the tweets after mr danczuk attended the raising of a pakistani flag over the town hall for half an hour on march 23 to mark pakistan 's national day . she wrote : ` raising a pakistani flag in rochdale is not helping community cohesion . @simondanczuk you & your party disgust me . ' outspoken hopkins posted a series of messages to her account after the mp tweeted a picture of himself at the event . in response the controversial columnist sent a picture of eight men convicted of child exploitation offences , asking mr danczuk if they were his friends too . she wrote : ` are these your friends too @simondanczuk ? is this why you are raising the pakistani flag in rochdale ? ` your pakistani friends saw young white girls as fair game when they abused them , ' she wrote in a separate post . ` do not lecture me on community cohesion fool . ' ` raising a pakistani flag in rochdale is not helping community cohesion , ' she added in another . @simondanczuk you & your party disgust me . ' explaining his decision to make the complaint , the mp said it was about the businesswoman ` inciting racial hatred ' . he said : ` the letter is me asking the police commissioner to investigate whether a crime has been committed in relation to katie hopkins . ' hopkins is said to have started sending the tweets after mr danczuk attended the raising of a pakistani flag over the town hall for half an hour on march 23 to mark pakistan 's national day he continued : ` it is not right that somebody who has little to do with rochdale incited hatred of this kind . ` rochdale is a very cohesive community - people work well together . ` of course there are tensions , like there are in other communities , but people rub together really well and we do n't need outsiders like katie hopkins to come in and cause trouble just for the sake of causing trouble and creating sun headlines . ' mr danczuk said rochdale has faced up to the ` heinous crime ' of child grooming ` in a way that 's managed to keep our communities together ' . he said : ` that 's why katie hopkins ' crass comments are not helpful . they are a clear attempt to divide communities , undo three years of hard work and make an unfair and racist generalisation that anyone of pakistani origin is a child abuser . ` to equate the pakistan flag with child abuse , as she has done on social media over the last week , is absurd and it creates a dangerous environment where extreme intolerance becomes acceptable . ` we have already seen taxi drivers stabbed in the face in race hate attacks and i 'm not prepared to allow people like hopkins , who know nothing about our town , to stir up tensions in such a dangerously provocative way that could lead to innocent people being attacked by extremists . ` as a result of her comments last week , i have been threatened by extremists and hard right groups have pledged to march on our town . i am a strong supporter of free speech but it has to be responsible - and that 's why we have laws to prevent people deliberately provoking hatred of a racial group . ' ms hopkins has been contacted for comment . she also sparked outrage yesterday after being accused of making a holocaust joke aimed at the wife of ed miliband -- even though his jewish parents fled from the nazis . ` raising a pakistani flag in rochdale is not helping community cohesion , ' she added in another . @simondanczuk you & your party disgust me ' she wrote : ` are these your friends too @simondanczuk ? is this why you are raising the pakistani flag in rochdale ? the controversial tv pundit faced calls for her arrest after saying the labour leader could ` gas ' his wife justine in a message on friday . she tweeted : ` pollsters say justine is the least popular of party wives . he might stick her head in the oven and turn on the gas . ' the outspoken star was then bombarded with hundreds of furious messages condemning her ` vile ' tweet , with one saying : ` you really are a deplorable and scummy piece of excrement . ' she has also courted controversy this week for her comments about the germanwings disaster . the tv pundit tweeted saying : ` sympathy for the co-pilot is making me angry . if you are suicidal , for goodness sake top yourself in private . attention seeking b ****** s. ' the controversial tv pundit faced calls for her arrest after saying the labour leader could ` gas ' his wife justine ( pictured together ) she followed this up with a number of tweets about depression , including : ` most depression is just genuine sadness at a social situation . like being caught in torrential rain with a bag from primark . ' meanwhile , mr danczuk confessed yesterday to watching pornography . the husband of selfie-loving karen danczuk was spotted favouriting hard-core porn on twitter - but blamed it on a fault with his iphone . however , the 48-year-old was unembarrassed about the gaffe . he stressed he does not use porn regularly , but insisted : ' i am a man of the world and it is part of life , many people do .

annie ramsay , 8 , was walking to the park with friends when she was attacked by a dog last week an eight-year-old girl has been left eating through a syringe after she was attacked by a springer spaniel that tore a centimetre off her lip and bit through her cheek . annie ramsay was walking with her friends near her home in whittle-le-woods , lancashire , on thursday when she bent down to stroke the dog as it made its way out of a park with its owner . her friend stroked the animal first before annie did the same but the spaniel , which was known to her , licked her face then sank its teeth into her cheek - puncturing her . she ran back home with blood pouring down her face screaming ` i 'm going to die ' as her horrified father , john , 47 , called for an ambulance . annie was rushed to hospital and underwent plastic surgery , where doctors used the inside or her lip to rebuild the part that had been torn off . she spent three days being treated before she was allowed back home on sunday , where she is still recovering . the attack has left her unable to eat and her mother rebecca ramsay , 34 , has to blend her food and feed it to her through a straw or with a syringe . mrs ramsay , who has two older sons , steven , 14 , and josh , 12 , said : ' i was heartbroken when i saw her . ` she was petrified but she 's been so brave and we 're really proud of her . she 's a huge dog lover and so sweet with animals so it was a big shock to her . ` the first day after the attack we could n't even mention the word " dog " around her - she was hysterical . ` but i 've been trying to explain to her that you get good dogs and bad dogs because i do n't want her to be frightened of them but at the same time part of me never wants her to go near one again . ' the schoolgirl had bent down to stroke the dog when it sunk its teeth into her cheek and tore a centimetre of skin from her lip . she was rushed to hospital and underwent plastic surgery to fix the damage the family was struck by tragedy in 2011 when annie 's older brother , dylan , drowned while swimming in a quarry near their home . ` since his death i have been campaigning around schools about safety and that 's where i was at when annie was attacked , ' said mrs ramsay . annie , who has since returned home to recover , is likely to have a hairline scar as a result of the attack ` she had been out playing with friends and the owner , who she knows and lives on our road , was coming out of the park and she stroked it like she has done several times before . ` it liked her face and that 's when it bit into her cheek and took about a centimetre off her lip . she ran home screaming and my husband shouted for a neighbour to call the ambulance . ` her brothers were terrified , especially after losing dylan so recently , about what would happen to their sister . ' i rushed to the hospital as soon as i heard and i could n't believe it when i saw her . but the doctors are hopeful and we have to share their enthusiasm that she will be okay . ' annie is recovering at home and was even strong enough to make it to a party on sunday where she met ` olaf ' from frozen . ` she 's in a lot of pain and on lots of antibiotics but she 's in really good spirits , ' she added . it 's likely she will be left with a hairline scar on her face , but her eye is expected to return fully to normal . lancashire constabulary confirmed that a warrant under the dangerous dogs act was executed and the dog seized . it remains in kennels and an investigation is under way , which will involve speaking to the victim any witnesses and the dog 's owner . mrs ramsay , whose own dog - a staffie cross - died recently , said : ` the police are carrying out interviews and will need to speak to annie in-depth before anything is done . ` there were lots of witnesses too so i think they need to speak to them as well . we 're not sure what is going to happen to the dog but it should be put down after what it 's done to my daughter .

ultra-conservative mp fred nile has lashed out at sydney 's mardi gras celebration , saying parenting , ` not promiscuity ' should be celebrated . the christian democratic party nsw mp made his comments on his official facebook page just as the party was getting underway across sydney and came as a television advertisement was aired during the parade , which claimed same-sex marriage would disadvantage children . a spokeswoman for mr nile , who spent the day campaigning in coffs harbour , said the post was designed to remind people of the importance of traditional relationships . ultra-conservative politician fred nile has lashed out at sydney 's mardi gras celebration , saying parenting not promiscuity should be celebrated . mr nile posted this image to his official facebook account on saturday , just as mardi gras parade celebrations were getting underway . marriage equality advocates have slammed an advertisement that aired during sydney 's mardi gras celebrations on saturday night claiming children from same-sex couples are disadvantaged . ` with so much coverage and celebration of mardi gras , it 's important to also be thankful for natural relationships - for the mum and the dad , ' the spokeswoman said . ` without that traditional relationship , natural reproduction would n't be possible . it 's very important to celebrate natural couples and those values . ' his controversial comments came as an advertisement claiming same-sex marriage disadvantaged children aired on tv on saturday night . it was organised and paid for by the australian marriage forum , a group ` disappointed with the one-sided debate ' surrounding the issue . the 40-second spot starts with a mother at a park saying : ` we hear a lot about marriage equality , but what about equality for kids ? ' dr david gend , president of the australian marriage forum and a family doctor based in toowoomba , queensland , says in the commercial that ` so-called marriage equality forces a child to miss out on a mother or a father ' . the gay and lesbian rights lobby accused the commercial of not only missing the point on marriage equality , but of also attempting to fight a losing battle . ` that 's not equality ; that 's not marriage , ' dr gend says . it also asks for supporters to donate money to the group . marriage equality advocates have slammed the ad , and said the campaign is trying to mislead people on the issue . ` the first point for us is that marriage equality and same-sex couples having children are two different equations , ' glrl co-convenor justin koonin told daily mail australia . ` same-sex couples already can and do have children - marriage equality is not going to change that . ` if the people behind this video were really thinking of the children , they would support marriage equality so that all kids , including those with same-sex parents , could say their parents are married . ' mr koonin also said most australians could see through claims that marriage equality disadvantages children , and that most had ` moved on ' from that discussion . ` they definitely are n't fooling anyone , ' he said . ` if they want to make that claim , have some evidence to support it . ` the majority of evidence shows there is no disadvantage to children with same-sex parents , and in fact most are slightly better off than average . ' dr david gend , president of the australian marriage forum says in the commercial that ` so-called marriage equality forces a child to miss out on a mother or a father ' . the controversial australian marriage forum commercial starts with a mother at a park saying : ` we hear a lot about marriage equality , but what about equality for kids ? ' the commercial has been widely criticised on social media , with more than 1200 people disliking the video on youtube , compared to just 150 who liked it . according to its website , the australian marriage forum is ` an organisation that has been set up to encourage australians to discuss the issue of same-sex marriage with some discernment and caution . ' it also states marriage equality would ` have enormous consequences on our culture ' and calls for a ` open and honest debate ... free of the intimidation that so many defenders of natural marriage have been subject to in recent years .

' i spoke to my vice president and said " we should do something , we do n't want to get into trouble " . ` but he said buffalo is allowed , so we 'll carry on as usual ' , he said . loophole : the 170-year-old club has said it will keep steak on the menu by sticking to its original recipes using ` buff ' - buffalo meat - rather than beef for the pies the 112-year-old taj mahal palace hotel removed beef from the menus on wednesday , according to chief sommelier abhas saxena - including its ` really sought-after ' chateaubriand steak . mr saxena said : ` beef has been on the hotel 's menu for many years . ` our signature restaurants were affected by the ban so we will have to look again at the dynamics of their menus . ` our chateaubriand , the tornado - a cut of meat - the tenderloin , the veal , all of that has been removed . it will definitely affect our business . ' he added : ` we still need to understand the thought process behind the ban . ` there are many segments of society being affected by this - from the folks who grow the cattle , to us who would be selling it .

a fort worth , texas elementary school has come under fire from parents who claim certain teachers and administrators have cultivated a ` toxic ' environment for their children . at a monday board meeting , parents turned out to support kourtney glaser , the former vice principal at comanche springs elementary school in the eagle mountain-saginaw independent school district , who was placed on administrative leave after she experienced heavy vaginal bleeding that the school claims was caused by ` severe anxiety . ' glaser , 31 , and her doctors , have firmly stated the bleeding , which occurred during a district training session and required glaser to seek immediate medical attention , was the result of an intrauterine device being lodged in her uterine wall . this was just the beginning of the parents complaints as well , as they also voiced their concern over ` staff drinking , ' the ` use of disparaging nicknames for teachers , parents and even children , ' and a principal who has been reassigned after her ` bullying tactics . ' kourtney glaser ( above ) , the vice principal at comanche springs elementary school in fort worth , texas was placed on leave because she had vaginal bleeding once parents got wind of this news , many rallied behind glasser , and seemed to place most of the blame on the principal , katy maurer ( above in leopard print top ) according to the fort worth star-telegram , glaser was forced to go to the emergency room on january 28 when she began suddenly bleeding , and two days later had her device removed to stop the trauma . she was not allowed to return to work however , and instead placed on leave after receiving a letter shortly after that said her bleeding had occurred on multiple occasions and was the result of ` severe anxiety . ' on top of this , she was told she would need to see two doctors and sign a waiver releasing her medical records before she would be allowed to return to work . the letter also claimed she had trouble speaking in front of large groups , something glasser denied in an interview with abc 8 . at this point , some parents at the school became aware of the situation , and seemed to place the blame on katy maurer , the principal of the school . the situation then became even further complicated when just last week maurer filed a police report claiming she was being harassed by an employee at the school and her husband . the name of the employee was not released , but it was revealed to be someone who was on leave . in her report , maurer claimed this employee had posted ` very hateful things ' about her on social media , and that these posts had led to national attention . the employee also reportedly referred to maurer as an ` idiot , ' while the employee 's husband is accused in the report of stalking maurer , coming to the school unannounced , following her to restaurants , and showing up at her home . maurer , 34 , said this has been going on for close to five weeks . the district said it is examining the claims , while a lawyer for glaser , brittany lannen , all but admitted she was the woman named in the report , saying ; ' " once the aggressor is caught , they attempt to play the victim . thankfully with today 's technology and social media , ms. maurer 's false accusations can easily be dismissed with a quick view of mrs. glaser 's social media . ' she also added that glaser 's husband was not ever told he could not be on school grounds . maurer , meanwhile , has been reassigned to another school in the district . ` it was a very sad situation , ' said retired teacher carol smith . smith then said of maurer ; ` she was hired against the recommendation of the committee , and i felt like i was working with a person in the seventh grade . ' parents brought up glaser 's situation at a meeting monday ( above ) , along with staff drinking on campus and the use of disparaging nicknames for students the district said it is investigating the leadership and these incidents at the school ( above ) pta member jennifer jordan said that maurer tries to exercise too much control over how decisions are made at the school , claiming she ` has tried to remove pta leaders , and has said she only wants people she likes on the board . ' there were also claims at monday 's meeting that maurer had ` misused pta travel funds for personal entertainment . ' ` my daughter is stuck in a horrible situation at comanche springs , ' said chad ferguson . ' i want my kids to grow up and feel like when something is not right , they have an obligation to try and make it right without fear of retribution . ' in a statement released last friday , the district said ; ` the administration of eagle mountain-saginaw isd is very aware of the concerns surrounding the leadership team at comanche springs elementary , and is actively working toward a resolution .

they might not have had quite as rapturous a reception as ` willkat ' but ` chacam ' , as the local media has christened them , certainly know how to put on a show . so far , the star is proving to be camilla who showed off her increasingly confident sense of style during a reception at the british ambassador 's residence in washington d.c last night . resplendent in a shimmering silk gown by bruce oldfield and her trademark pearl choker , the duchess of cornwall cut a glamorous figure as she arrived on the arm of prince charles . glamorous : camilla in a chic bruce oldfield gown during a banquet on the second day of the us tour looking good : the duchess has also used the occasion to show off a chic new haircut but camilla is n't the only one who has proved a hit with the us public , with charles also pulling in the crowds - most obviously during a whistle-stop tour of washington 's many monuments yesterday . arriving to cries of ` welcome your highness ! ' , a clearly delighted prince of wales happily stopped to chat to schoolchildren and their parents outside the lincoln memorial . not everyone knew who they were however , with one little boy asking his mother : ` who is that man ? ' ` the future king of england , ' she replied as she swiftly snapped a photo on her iphone . charles and camilla are now on the third day of a four-day state visit that has been described as ` your grandfather 's royal visit ' by the local washington post . new name : the royal couple have been re-christened ` chacam ' by the local media warm welcome : both charles and camilla have enjoyed a rapturous reception from local people in a piece headlined , ` camilla and charles do n't get the willkat [ william and kate ] treatment , but it 's still royal ' , the paper went on to contrast the ` high-volume excitement worthy of boy-band ' that greeted the duke of cambridge with the quieter one offered to his father . but while charles and camilla are n't getting the rockstar reaction enjoyed by the younger generation , the visit is seen as ` crucial ' - for charles at least . that echoes comments made by british ambassador to the us sir peter westmacott who described the tour as being a fillip for anglo-american relations . ' i am so pleased to welcome the prince of wales and the duchess of cornwall back to the united states , ten years after their first official visit together , ' he said ahead of the royal couple 's arrival on tuesday night . looking around : charles and camilla spent their first full day touring washington d.c star of the show : camilla , who is clearly been enjoying the tour , has enjoyed a particularly warm welcome yesterday , the duchess obligingly posed for a selfie outside the lincoln memorial cheering for charles : local teenagers wait for the royal couple to emerge from the lincoln memorial ` their trip to washington and kentucky will showcase the best of the transatlantic relationship - promoting democratic values , combating climate change , preserving the natural environment , creating opportunities for the next generation - and provide yet another reminder of the essential role the royal family play in keeping that relationship special . ' much of the itinerary is taken up with marking big anniversaries , among them the 800th birthday of the magna carta and the 150th anniversary of abraham lincoln 's assassination . both were ticked off the list yesterday , with charles and camilla starting the day at the lincoln memorial in washington and , in charles ' case , ending it at the national archives for a viewing of the 1297 magna carta . today 's schedule , which , if yesterday is any indication , will also be covered rather breathlessly by the local press , will see ` chacam ' visit president lincoln 's cottage in washington d.c. later , the royal couple will be whisked to the white house where they will meet president obama in the oval office for the second time since he took office . president obama is the sixth american president to entertain charles , who has visited the us on 23 separate occasions , during his royal career and is unlikely to be the last . tour : yesterday afternoon saw them visit mount vernon , the home of president george washington patriotic : camilla is introduced to a british airedale named gunner who was dressed in a union flag scarf cuddle : gunner was on the receiving end of a right royal pat courtesy of the duchess of cornwall pleased to see you : camilla gets a warm welcome from performers at the shakespeare theatre company shake on it : the duchess shakes hands with well-wishers as she leaves the shakespeare theatre company

downing street was last night claiming victory in the battle over the election tv debates after ed miliband was forced to line up with the minnow parties on a ` night of the non-entities ' . labour reacted with fury when the broadcasters announced -- after weeks of wrangling -- that neither david cameron nor nick clegg would be invited to the second debate on april 16 . only the non-governing parties will feature , meaning mr miliband will appear with the leaders of ukip , the snp , the greens and plaid cymru . david cameron will only appear in one full debate , hosted by itv on thursday , april 2 , with the six other party leaders ed miliband will have to line up with the minnow parties on a ` night of the non-entities ' because neither david cameron nor nick clegg will be invited to the second debate on april 16 mr clegg 's absence means that mr miliband will not be able to accuse mr cameron of being ` chicken ' by avoiding the exchange , or force the broadcasters to ` empty chair ' the prime minister . no10 has also successfully killed the idea of a direct head-to-head debate between mr cameron and mr miliband . the two men will instead join mr clegg in making individual appearances in front of a studio audience for a bbc question time special . it means that mr cameron will only appear in one full debate , hosted by itv on thursday , april 2 , with the six other party leaders . the announcement of the broadcasters ' final plans represents a triumph for downing street strategists , who did not want the election campaign to be dominated by the debates , as it was in 2010 , on the grounds that mr miliband 's stock is already so low with the public he had the least to lose . but the lib dems have described the final arrangements as a ` farce ' . and labour issued an angry statement accusing the broadcasters of reneging on a commitment to proceed with the head-to-head debate programme after ` weeks of pressure from the conservative party ' , insisting that the ` cowardice ' of mr cameron had thwarted the head-to-head encounter . labour also claimed that mr clegg had been excluded from the april 16 debate ` at the conservative party 's insistence ' to provide cover for the pm 's absence . labour has claimed that nick clegg ( pictured ) had been excluded from the april 16 debate ` at the conservative party 's insistence ' to provide cover for the pm 's absence ukip leader nigel farage areacted angrily , saying tv debates were now ` so far from the original proposals ' a labour spokesman said : ` the whole country will understand the reasons for this : the prime minister wants to minimise the scope of televised debates between himself and ed miliband . ` we hope that even at this late stage david cameron will rethink his decision not to take part on april 16 . ` the prime minister 's repeated attempts to dictate the abandonment of these tv programmes to independent broadcasters is deeply worrying . ' the spokesman added that after the election labour would seek to put future debate programmes on a statutory footing . ukip leader nigel farage also reacted angrily , saying : ` tv debates are now so far from the original proposals . they 've kow-towed to manipulation from downing street . ' in a joint statement , the bbc , itv , sky and channel 4 said : ` we 're delighted there will be a debate with all the party leaders during the campaign . the debate on april 2 will build on the success of the 2010 tv debates so valued by viewers . ' a lib dem spokesman said : ` if it was down to us , we would be in every tv debate . but the politicians and broadcasters have ducked and dived on this long enough and need to get on with it . frankly this is all a farce ' . a no10 spokesman said : ` we have agreed to the broadcasters ' proposal .

from marlene who requires shots in her eyeballs to julia who needs an ostomy bag taped to a hole in her abdomen - the scenes from this anti-smoking campaign are aimed to make you cringe . the new tips from former smokers ad by the centers for disease control and prevention highlights two smoking-related conditions macular degeneration , a blinding eye disease , and colorectal cancer . the campaign which originally launched in 2012 will begin running on march 30 featuring five former smokers in a bid to stop people from smoking . marlene , 68 , started smoking when she was 15 years old and now has to have treatments involving shots to her eyeballs marlene , 68 , of new york began smoking in high school when she was 15 , and started losing her vision due to macular degeneration when she was 56 years old . ` please do n't end up like me . do n't sit in a doctor 's chair , have a clamp put on your eye , and have needles stuck in your eyeballs . it 's horrible , ' marlene told nbc . apart from quitting smoking , her best chance to slow down her vision loss is a drug that has to be injected through a needle into her eyes . marlene must get the shots every month which is a stomach-churning process to watch in the video , the stomach-churning treatment she undergoes every month is revealed just before the needle goes into her eye . so far , she has had more than 100 shots in each eye . ` this will probably go on for the rest of my life , ' she said . ` if i 'd had a crystal ball many years ago , i would never have put that first cigarette in my mouth . ' she added : ' i want to see the sun . i want to see the water . i 'm so sorry that i started smoking . ' the new tips from former smokers ad by the centers for disease control and prevention highlights colon cancer , which julia suffers from the campaign also features former smokers mark , 47 , of california an air force veteran who developed rectal cancer when he was 42 . he also has to use an ostomy bag . julia , 58 , of mississippi smoked for more than 20 years before she developed colon cancer at 49 years old and requires an ostomy bag , while kristy , 35 , of tennesee smoked until her lung collapsed and was later diagnosed with early copd , a lung disease . while many of the stories show the heart-breaking aftermath of smoking , some of them have happier endings . mark , 47 , an air force veteran who developed rectal cancer when he was 42 and is required to use an ostomy bag tiffany , 35 , whose mother died from lung cancer when she was 16 , decided to stop smoking when her own daughter turned 16 years old . smoking is the leading cause of preventable illness and death in the united states . it 's responsible for the majority of the nation 's lung cancer deaths and is a deadly factor in heart attacks and a variety of other illnesses . in 2012 , the agency 's $ 54 million campaign was its first and largest national advertising effort . the government deemed it a success : that campaign triggered an increase of 200,000 calls to quit lines . the cdc believes that likely prompted tens of thousands of smokers to quit based on calculations that a certain percentage of callers do actually stop . like last year , the 20-week campaign spotlights real people who were hurt and disfigured by smoking . she made the decision so that she could be around for the important milestones of her daughter 's life . her ad will run as a public service announcement . ` all the tips ad participants are heroes , ' said dr. tim mcafee , director of cdc 's office on smoking and health . ` by courageously sharing their painful personal stories , they 're inspiring millions of americans to make the life-saving decision to quit smoking . ' the cdc said its campaign has helped prompt millions of smokers to try to quit , and that in 2014 when ads were on air , nearly 80 per cent more contacted the national quitline , 1-800-quit-now . the campaign in 2013 featured terrie , a north carolina woman who lost her voice box , and later died from throat and oral cancer . ` over a million and a half smokers made a quit attempt because of our 12 week campaign -- just a 12-week campaign created this effect , ' mcafee told nbc . ` over a hundred thousand people quit successfully and permanently because of the campaign .

david warner and aaron finch will have the chance to impose themselves on new zealand as australia bid for a fifth world cup final victory - and the two openers are hoping they have saved their best for last . warner and finch 's destructive partnership has only intermittently fired over the past six weeks as australia have nonetheless booked their place in sunday 's mcg final against their fellow tournament co-hosts . victorian finch , who will have home comforts on the famously huge playing area , made only his second half-century of the campaign in australia 's semi-final win over india in sydney . david warner thank the crowd after winning the semi final against india but it was at the mcg where he smashed hapless england for 135 on valentine 's day , and he returns in good heart after his hard-earned 81 against the defending champions on thursday . ` it was n't my most fluid innings but it was nice to get through that , ' he said . ' i was under the pump - i had n't scored any runs for a while . ' i felt like i was playing really well . it 's just one of those things - it did n't translate into a hell of a lot of runs lately . ` but i hope i 'm past that and there 's some more runs to come . ' warner has had one feast - a career-best 178 against afghanistan in perth - and , by his standards , some famine in the world cup so far . aaron finch will hope to make an impact for australia in the world cup final like finch , playing in the tournament for the first time , he told australia 's sky sports radio : ` it 's just those easy ` outs ' that are causing a bit of a stir in my mind . ' warner was caught from a leading edge into the ring field against india , and added : ` it 's not great to have big edges ( on your bat ) sometimes . ` but every time i 've come in i 've looked a million dollars , i 've hit every ball in the middle and i 've just got to find a way to get past that ( first ) 10 overs , be clinical and bat deep . ' the kiwis need to get their minds right too , of course , to upset the odds . they are being portrayed as outsiders but remain the only unbeaten team in the tournament and scored a narrow victory over australia in an epic , low-scoring group match in auckland at the end of last month . mitchell johnson celebrates taking the wicket of india 's rohit sharma on their way to the world cup final australia celebrate their win over india in the world cup semi-final much has been made of australia 's home advantage for the rematch , but new zealand insist they are not fazed . seamer matt henry was not supposed to be involved at all until injury intervened for adam milne . henry was brought into the squad as a replacement and acquitted himself well for economical figures in tuesday 's semi-final win over south africa . he said : ` this is definitely something i will never forget . ` as a kid , you grow up pretending to be these [ cricket ] heroes , like playing with my brother out the back and going through scenarios like running in to bowl at a world cup final . ` you have to pinch yourself . ` i 've been presented with an opportunity which i 'm very grateful for and excited about . ' fellow seamer tim southee will take the new ball alongside trent boult , and is confident - whatever the conditions . ` we 're not too worried about the size of the ground , ' said southee . ` it 's a dream come true for all the guys . as a kid growing up , you either want to be an all black or a black cap . ` this is as good as it gets , taking on australia in australia on one of the best cricket grounds in the world . ' swing is the forte for southee and boult , but attuning to the sell-out atmosphere will be the starting point . ` there 's going to be a lot of people . it 's going to be loud , ' said southee . ` there will be close to 100,000 people screaming . ` it will be interesting to see what it 's like here . ' brendon mccullum 's visitors , like michael clarke 's hosts , appear set to name an unchanged team with veteran left-arm orthodox daniel vettori expected to be fit after all .
a 94th-minute goal by substitute martyn waghorn rescued a sky bet championship point for wigan athletic in a 1-1 draw at home to bolton , who looked as though they were going to pull off the classic smash-and-grab . the home side had dominated for the vast majority of the contest , only to fall behind 20 minutes from time when tom walker 's shot was deflected past a helpless ali al habsi for the opener . it was a crushing blow for a wigan side that had hit the bar in the first half through james perch , had a leon clarke goal chalked off for offside and seen marc-antoine fortune fluff a relatively straight-forward heading chance . a 94th-minute goal by substitute martyn waghorn rescued a point for wigan athletic against bolton but they stuck to their task in the second period , and after ben amos had denied jermaine pennant with a stunning stop , the goalkeeper then tipped a clarke header on to the bar as well as clawing away a sheyi ojo effort . it looked like time would run out on wigan , but in the fourth of five added minutes , waghorn equalised with a goal that could yet save their season . wigan had started the game on the front foot , with bolton content to play on the break . and the visitors showed their threat inside the early exchanges when adam le fondre led a breakaway only for gaetan bong to save the day in the nick of time . wigan were getting the ball wide at every opportunity to wingers josh murphy - making his full debut - and pennant . but it was through the middle that they nearly broke the deadlock , with perch 's 30-yard effort beating amos only to hit the bar and come back out . the ball fell invitingly for clarke , but the striker 's header was weak and straight at amos . wigan xi : al habsi , boyce ( kvist - 78 ) , maguire , pearce , bong , pennant ( ojo - 67 ) , kim , perch , murphy , fortune ( waghorn - 78 ) , clarke subs not used : carson , taylor , mckay , cowie bolton xi : amos , mills , mccarthy , ream , feeney , trotter , bannan , rocha ( vela - 55 ) , walker ( moxey - 82 ) , le fondre ( davies - 68 ) , heskey subs not used : bogdan , dervite , gudjohnsen , twardzik at the other end , walker could not make the most of liam feeney 's cross , and the same player was unable to make amends moments later when he fired past the post . former wigan man emile heskey had a great opportunity to open the scoring on the half-hour mark but his free header from a corner flashed past the upright . latics ended the half on a high and should have taken the lead when murphy 's pinpoint cross found fortune , whose header from point-blank was straight at amos when either side would surely have brought about the opening goal . wigan did have the ball in the net right on half-time through clarke , but the striker looked well offside and the flag was up on the far side . the home side picked up where they left off after the restart , and a pennant free-kick bound for the top corner was superbly clawed out by amos . pennant then had time and space in the box to pick his spot on the edge of the area , but his shot hit clarke and was hacked away to safety . the visitors won a couple of corners but they were virtually non-existent as an attacking force , with wigan asking all the questions . but with 20 minutes to go , the unthinkable happened and wanders took an undeserved lead in extremely fortuitous circumstances . walker 's shot from distance took a massive deflection off a defender , completely wrong-footing al habsi and rolling into the net to the delight of the packed away end behind the goal . credit goes to wigan for the way they stuck to their task , and amos produced another fabulous stop to deny substitute ojo before clarke saw a header tipped on to the bar by the goalkeeper . it looked as though bolton were going to hold on for all three points before , in the fourth added minute , waghorn sent an overhead kick in off the bar to rescue a point for the hosts .

( cnn ) a bill that would allow utah to use firing squads to execute some death-row prisoners passed in the state senate on tuesday . the measure , which passed 18 to 10 , will be sent to gov. gary herbert , who has not said whether he will sign it into law or veto the bill . herbert released a statement on the legislation , which would add death by firing squad as an option in a state that uses lethal injection . " our statute is clear that lethal injection is the method by which ( an execution ) will happen . we have no intent to change that , " he said . the law would give the state the option to use a five-member squad in cases where the drugs necessary for lethal injection are n't available 30 days before the date set for the execution . " our state , as is the case with states around the country , is finding it increasingly difficult to obtain the substances required to perform a lethal injection . we are dedicated to pursuing all reasonable and legal options to obtain those substances to make sure that , when required , we are in a position to carry out this very serious sentence by lethal injection , " the governor said . eight people are on utah 's death row . utah banned death by firing squad in 2004 , though inmates who chose that option before the law changed still ended up being shot to death . the last execution by firing squad was in 2010 , and it was also the most recent execution in utah . a utah firing squad also executed gary gilmore in 1977 , the first death by capital punishment after the u.s. supreme court reinstated the death penalty the prior year . in recent years , states have struggled to maintain a supply of lethal injection drugs as manufacturers either stopped producing the drugs or barred their use in executions . texas nearly out of execution drug the european manufacturers of pentobarbital , an anesthetic , explicitly banned u.s. prisons from using its drug in executions . some states have sought out substitutes or gone with one drug instead of the traditional three-drug cocktail . in april , oklahoma used midazolam as a substitute for pentobarbital as part of a three-drug cocktail in an execution that went awry . clayton lockett , a convicted rapist and murderer , writhed and convulsed after the drugs were administered . it took 43 minutes for him to die . last week , georgia postponed an execution because the drugs appeared " cloudy . " the state also indefinitely postponed at least one other execution until it can analyze the cocktail it uses for the procedures , officials said . georgia halts executions to analyze lethal drug cocktail cnn 's tony marco contributed to this report .

a mother jailed for allowing her children to ` pick and choose ' when they went to school because she thought they would learn ` more on a beach than in a hot stuffy classroom ' now admits she was wrong . claudia ward , 42 , said prison was the wake-up call she needed and that her children all now had 100 per cent attendance records . miss ward said she initially wanted her six children to have ` an amount of choice themselves ' . she admitted that if her two older children were up late and ` did n't fancy ' going to school she would let them stay off . admits her fault : claudia ward ( centre ) , pictured with her children riley ( left ) , six , and nia ( right ) , nine , had argued that her children would gain more from a ` free-thinking ' day on the beach or a woodland walk on other occasions she said she had ` just wanted some company ' . but their schools and her local education authority disagreed with her flexible approach and she was prosecuted five times before being jailed for five months . miss ward admitted : ` when i spent my first night in the cell , the enormity of what i had done hit home . ' i felt so guilty ; my stubbornness had meant i was on a prison wing in gloucester , miles away from my young and vulnerable children . great outdoors : miss ward let her children play truant because she thought they would learn more on day trips . pictured above are two of her six children - riley ( left ) and nia ( right ) ` i accepted that my views on education were not correct and everyone must adhere to the same rules , or there would be anarchy . it was the wake-up call i needed . ' miss ward , who is single , has six children : jack , 24 , amos , 21 , rudy 17 , annie , 16 , nia , nine , and riley , six . they have four different fathers . she was prosecuted in 2008 and then again in 2011 and 2012 . but the court heard her children 's ` attendance issues ' dated back to 2002 . ` if it was a sunny day and i thought one of my children would have been bored and sat staring out the window of the classroom wishing they were at the beach -- i could not see the merit of them not being on the beach looking at rock pools , ' said miss ward , a freelance creative writer from falmouth , cornwall . ` i thought they would gain far more from that . i thought they would be far better actually there experiencing it rather than sat in a stuffy classroom . riley and nia : the children were looked after by other family members while miss ward was in prison ` my ideas for education were always more outside the box and free-thinking , ' she added . ` i was all about the children having an amount of choice themselves . ` this did n't tally well with the national curriculum . it got to the point where there was no room for dialogue with the school and it was conflict all the way . ' reflected in her cell : miss ward was jailed for five months in 2013 at truro magistrates ' court during the 2012 court hearing -- which miss ward failed to attend -- magistrates were told that three of the children 's education was suffering through their absences and one had missed a gcse exam . liz mozeley , education welfare officer , told truro magistrates ' court : ` she felt they could pick and choose when they go . ' on that occasion , after a warrant was issued for her arrest , she was given a 12-week prison sentence suspended for 24 months . but the truanting continued and she was jailed for 20 weeks in february 2013 . cornwall council said it has been working with her for a decade at a cost of about # 15,000 and prosecution was a ` last resort ' . education welfare officer john heath told the court : ` claudia is a capable woman but has a very odd outlook as far as education is concerned . ' the court heard that three of the children ; annie , nia and riley , missed more than a third of sessions between september and december 2012 -- equalling 73 whole days . miss ward served ten weeks of her 20-week jail term . she was released in april 2013 . her children were looked after by other family members . she said : ` i was shocked and did not for one second did i think they would give me a five-month sentence . ' she said she used her time inside to re-evaluate her principles .

' the british life photography awards recognises the country 's ` obsession ' with the weather . on the category section , it states : ` blessed with four seasons , british weather moulds our landscape , coast , the environment and communities . ' and the photos the judges are after are ` images from parched landscapes to flooded meadows , windswept moors to spring sunlight . ' many households on the coast were left without power after ferocious storms swept in from the atlantic unsurprisingly , all trains lines were suspended in cornwall at the height of the storm , with structural engineers working overtime in january and february 2014 hundreds of homes were flooded as the worst storms in 20 years continued to cause misery across the country . waves as high as 30 feet battered the coastline at porthleven as storm hercules reared its ugly head after moving across the atlantic over the early part of last year . there were thousands of 999 calls in cornwall alone , and the environment agency issued as many as 340 storm warnings across the country , warning of serious risk to life .

in reality , dick advocaat has six games to save sunderland 's season and his own proud record of never having been relegated . for you can as good as write off the last two matches of this desperate campaign , trips to arsenal and chelsea . sunderland have not won away in 2015 and there is no evidence to suggest they will start to do so at the home of top-four opponents . sunderland interim manager dick advocaat has said his side will play ` ugly ' football if they need to advocaat 's sunderland debut was marred by a 1-0 defeat at west ham thanks to diafra sakho 's late goal west ham striker nene ( left ) jumps for the ball alongside sunderland defender patrick van aanholt ( right ) advocaat set out with beautiful intent at west ham , naming three strikers having 24 hours earlier rubbished mention of his defensive reputation -- but things have very quickly got ugly . ` the only important thing in the final games is winning , ' said the 67-year-old , whose premier league debut ended in defeat when diafra sakho struck two minutes from time . ` the way we do that is not important . so if we win games very ugly i like that . we will play very negative if the need is there . ' advocaat has given his players the early part of the week off , an agreed rest period which is the legacy of gus poyet 's ill-fated reign . the dutchman joked that the club do n't have too many international players so their preparations for the visit of north-east rivals newcastle a week on sunday will not be disrupted . that , you feel , is a match sunderland must now win . by a quirk of footballing fate , previous bosses paolo di canio and poyet both enjoyed derby victories in their second match in charge . sunderland winger adam johnson prepares to strike the ball after coming on as a substitute on saturday for advocaat , it is arguably his most winnable game of the eight remaining . defeat is not an option . ` being at home in derbies gives a big advantage , ' he added . ' i know the intensity of these games -- i was involved many times in rangers against celtic . ' i made the mistake of perhaps not realising that at first and i lost 5-1 . ` but newcastle for us now is the most important thing . we have a good period to practise and i think the ( international ) break is a good thing . i have time now to see what my best line-up will be .

' i do n't know why people have speculated about me and sunderland , ' he said . ` i 'm doing what i did here in my second year , my contract was running out then . ` at the end of the season we will look at the squad . we have to get more players in to build the club and make sure we sustain the growth we are achieving at this point in time .

london ( cnn ) the bbc producer allegedly struck by jeremy clarkson will not press charges against the " top gear " host , his lawyer said friday . clarkson , who hosted one of the most-watched television shows in the world , was dropped by the bbc wednesday after an internal investigation by the british broadcaster found he had subjected producer oisin tymon " to an unprovoked physical and verbal attack . " tymon went to a hospital emergency department to receive treatment for a split lip following the march 4 incident at a hotel in north yorkshire , it said . north yorkshire police said they had asked the bbc for a copy of the report and would assess whether further police action needed to be taken . " no one who was present at the hotel during the incident came forward to report an offense to the police . nonetheless , we have a duty to investigate where we believe an offense might have been committed , and that is what we have been doing with this case , " police said in a statement thursday . " as is usual in these circumstances , we have made contact with mr tymon through his lawyers , to ask him to speak to us so we can ascertain how he wishes to pursue this matter . " tymon issued a statement through his lawyer friday saying he had informed police he did not want to press charges . " the events of the last few weeks have been extremely unpleasant for everyone involved . the matter has taken a great toll on oisin , his family and his friends , " lawyer paul daniels said . " quite simply , mr tymon just wishes to return now to the job at the bbc he loves , as soon as possible . further , the bbc have , in his view , taken action with a view to addressing the issues at hand . " mr tymon agrees with the bbc 's stated view that all parties should now be allowed to move on , so far as possible . " tymon had earlier said he was grateful to the bbc for their " thorough and swift investigation into this very regrettable incident . " " i 've worked on top gear for almost a decade , a program i love . over that time jeremy and i had a positive and successful working relationship , making some landmark projects together . he is a unique talent and i am well aware that many will be sorry his involvement in the show should end in this way , " he said . clarkson was suspended on march 10 after what the bbc initially described as the " fracas " with tymon . ken macquarrie , who conducted the internal investigation into the incident , said tymon had been struck " resulting in swelling and bleeding to his lip . " the physical attack was halted after about 30 seconds by the intervention of a witness , macquarrie said , but clarkson continued to use " derogatory and abusive language " for a sustained period of time . macquarrie said clarkson made a number of attempts to apologize over subsequent days and had reported the incident to bbc management . announcing wednesday that clarkson 's contract would not be renewed , bbc director general tony hall said a " line had been crossed . " " a member of staff -- who is a completely innocent party -- took himself to accident and emergency after a physical altercation accompanied by sustained and prolonged verbal abuse of an extreme nature . for me a line has been crossed , " he said . " i know how popular the program is and i also know that this decision will divide opinion . " in 2013 , guinness world records named " top gear " the world 's most widely watched factual program , with an estimated 350 million global viewers . the show -- fronted by clarkson , james may and richard hammond -- is sold to 214 territories worldwide . local versions have been made in the united states , china , russia , australia and south korea . after his suspension by the bbc , clarkson changed his twitter profile to " i am probably a presenter on the bbc2 motoring show , top gear . " on wednesday , the wording became past tense : " i used to be a presenter on the bbc2 motoring show , top gear . " co-host richard hammond tweeted : " gutted at such a sad end to an era . we 're all three of us idiots in our different ways but it 's been an incredible ride together . " on friday james may also tweeted , saying : " i 've written some blues lyrics : oh i woke up this morning , and ... #still unemployed . " fans had earlier expressed outrage at the bbc decision to suspend clarkson . an online petition to have clarkson reinstated has been signed by more than a million people . fewer than 10,000 people signed a counterpetition calling for him to be fired . last week , a fan dressed as the " stig " -- the anonymous racing car test-driver who was once a regular feature of the show -- drove to the bbc 's london headquarters in an armored tank to present the " bring back clarkson " petition . clarkson later thanked his supporters in a tweet shared more than 22,000 times . while clarkson 's abrasive style has proven popular with viewers , his on - and off-air comments have earned him a reputation as a politically incorrect maverick who often walks a fine line between humor and offense . last year , he apologized profusely after being accused of mumbling the n-word in a clip that was n't aired . " i 'd actually used the word i was trying to obscure . i was mortified by this , horrified . it is a word i loathe , " clarkson said in video statement posted online . he 's been accused on other occasions of racism , including characterizing mexicans as " lazy and feckless " and using the word " slope " over footage of an asian man crossing a bridge during a " top gear " special in myanmar . producer andy wilman later apologized , calling it a " light-hearted word play joke , " and saying that the team was not aware that it was offensive to asians . last week , clarkson launched into an expletive-filled rant at a charity auction in north london , verbally attacking his bbc bosses . a cnn reporter who was at the event said clarkson swore often as he talked about his suspension from the show , saying the bbc had " f**ked themselves " and had ruined a great show . clarkson later brushed off the incident , saying the rant was meant " in jest " and was designed to increase bids for the prize being auctioned -- one last lap of the " top gear " race track .
( cnn ) what does it take to help a single dolphin entangled in fishing line ? in the recent case of a dolphin calf rescued off the eastern coast of florida , about two days of effort involving seven boats and 35 people from 12 institutions and organizations . and that was after four weeks spent finding him and evaluating his situation to see whether it warranted intervention . with spring approaching , marine experts say it 's a good reminder to look after your belongings when you take to the water . from plastic bags to swimming trunks to crab pots , marine life can get entangled in all manner of human debris . with limited time and resources , experts ca n't save them all . " you really want to make sure you keep all your hands on your stuff , " said elizabeth stratton , national oceanic and atmospheric administration fisheries ' assistant marine mammal stranding coordinator for the southeast region . " we feel a special responsibility in cases where an animal 's health is in danger because of debris introduced by humans , " said stratton , who was involved in last week 's rescue . so where does an intervention begin ? a couple spotted the calf off the coast of fort pierce with monofilament line wrapped around his rostrum , or snout . the mammal was riding the wake of their boat . they reported it january 18 to the harbor branch oceanographic institution , which set out to find the calf and his mother . the group found the pair and took more pictures , which were sent to the noaa fisheries on february 9 for evaluation . the photos revealed monofilament line wrapped around the calf 's upper jaw , cutting into the tissue to the bone , threatening his ability to eat or possibly leading to infection . veterinarians who reviewed the photos deemed the injuries potentially life-threatening . " we ca n't disentangle every animal , " stratton said , " but if it comes back as life-threatening , we mobilize to do disentanglement . " the next step was to find the creatures again . through characteristics on the mother 's dorsal fin , the group was able to identify her through records on file and target her home range for a search . after a two-day search , the group found the dolphins on friday and approached for intervention . the process took about an hour , from netting the calf and his mother to sending them on their way , stratton said . apart from the fishing line both mother and son were in good condition . rescuers gave the calf a long-lasting antibiotic and radio-tagged the mother before releasing them to the ocean " where they belong , " stratton said . the moral of the story for humans : " be conscious of your gear . " to report an injured marine mammal , call 877-whalehelp ( 877-942-5343 ) .

budget prices : aldi is introducing wagyu burgers at # 2.99 each in a bid to chase from new zealand as it steps up its chase for middle and high income shoppers an a list celebrity might spend # 29 on a wagyu burger at london 's dorchester hotel -- after all it is renowned around the world as a byword for luxury given its flavour and succulence . alternatively , you could try the local aldi , where the budget chain is introducing wagyu burgers at # 2.99 each . the budget chain is to offer a limited stock of wagyu burgers made with beef imported from new zealand as it steps up its chase for middle and high income shoppers . normally , luxury restaurants , stores and gourmet butchers sell the beef for the equivalent of an eye-watering # 100 per kilo -- so putting it out of reach for most families . however , aldi is bringing the beef , which originated with pampered cattle in japan , to the masses . last year the company sold wagyu sirloin and rib-eye steaks at # 6.99 each , which resulted in something of a stampede among the bmw-driving classes . it believes the burgers will be similarly successful . wagyu beef stands out from other meat because of its distinctive marbling with fat , which melts into the meat during cooking to produce a fabulous taste and moist texture . the cattle were initially introduced to japan as a beast of burden to help cultivate rice during the 2nd century . beer was fed to the animals during the hot summers to stimulate appetite , while massaging was used to prevent muscles cramping on small farms in japan where the animals did not have sufficient room to move around . kobe beef is the purest , highest quality of the meat , which is produced from the black tajima-ushi breed of wagyu cattle and raised according to strict tradition . however , the demand and appetite for the beef is now so great that herds are now being reared across the globe , including the uk and new zealand . beef from wagyu cows is sold for as much as # 100 per kilo in luxury restaurants and gourmet butchers aldi said the decision to stock the burgers was inspired by the menu at the oscars ball . stars such as bradley cooper , eddie redmayne and julianne moore were amongst the 1,500 members of hollywood royalty to dine at infamous governors ball , where mini american wagyu burgers served with aged cheddar were on the menu . the chain 's managing director of corporate buying , tony baines , said : ` at aldi our shoppers love to try out lots of specialist products , and wagyu is no exception . following the frenzy around the wagyu steaks aldi sold last summer , we wanted to offer something new that would excite our customers . following his oscar success , eddie redmayne dined at the governors ball where mini american wagyu burgers served with aged cheddar were on the menu ` aldi 's specially selected wagyu burgers are made from premium quality wagyu beef , and are available at an everyday low price , which our customers have come to know and love . ' at the dorchester bar , the # 29 wagyu burger is served with tomato relish and truffle mayonnaise . aldi suggests teaming its version with its specially selected brioche burger buns , which are 99p for four , and a pack of roquefort cheese , which is # 2.29 . that would give a price for the aldi version of less than # 4 -- assuming you only need a few slices of the cheese .
ronny deila secured his first trophy triumph as celtic manager -- then cut short the celebrations by slapping a midnight curfew on his players . goals from kris commons and substitute james forrest -- who also missed a late penalty -- secured the scottish league cup against 10-man dundee united . with the sides set to meet for a third time in 10 days in wednesday 's scottish cup replay , however , the parkhead coach warned his players to forget any notions of a scott brown-style blow-out . ronny deila hopes to become the third celtic manager to achieve a domestic treble with the bhoys ` we should enjoy the moment , but there is not going to be any nightlife , ' deila said , reacting to the furore created by his skipper 's revelry in edinburgh strip clubs four nights before the final . ` the players will have a calm night . we will go back to the stadium and have a couple of beers and enjoy it , but it will be early to bed before midnight and be ready for training tomorrow at 1pm . ' deila then joked : ` for the staff it 's a little bit longer . ' despite urging his players to be ` 24-hour athletes ' earlier this season the norwegian played down the seriousness of the brown incident , with pictures of the skipper slumped on a pavement plastered over the pages of newspapers . scott brown lifts the scottish league cup alongside craig gordon ( right ) after a difficult week in the headlines insisting there was no question or disciplinary action or dropping the 29-year-old , deila added : ` this case , for me , is not a big one . he was home at 10.30 . it just looks like he was home at six in the morning . ` he was drinking , he had a day off the day after . i have no rules about that . i said the players have to be fit -- and scott brown is the fittest player we have . ` but we have a reputation to take care of and the way the pictures appeared in the newspaper was nothing for him or me to be proud of . so we have to learn from this . ` when you play for celtic everybody chases you and you do n't get the personal time . ` you have to always know what you are doing . celtic manager ronny deila gets ready to lift the scottish league cup with his players on sunday ` this is something everybody has to learn from -- but , again , it was not a big issue for me . ' asked if brown had apologised , the parkhead boss added : ` he was not happy about it , but he did n't do anything big or harmful for me . ` it 's not a positive example for youngsters . but broony has played 60 or 65 matches this year , he had a day off and wanted to be out with his friends . ` as i said he was home at 10.30 pm so it was not a big thing . we will see if he learns in the future but he made up for it today -- he played a very good game . ' keeper craig gordon gets the drinks flowing in the dressing room and sprays champagne ast his team-mates stefan johansen was also quick to support his captain with the 29-year-old leading his club to the first leg of what celtic hope will be a rare treble . and despite admitting it was ; not what you want to see ' , johansen insists his midfield colleague showed his class in sunday 's 2-0 win . ` i think broonie showed what a captain he is today -- a captain with a big letter at the front , ' johansen said . ` i thought he was absolutely fantastic . he 's 100 per cent in training every day so when that ( night out picture ) came up i was n't concerned , not even a little bit . celtic manager ronny deila urges his side to remain focused as they continue to chase a domestic treble ` it 's not what you want to see happening , but it 's happened and you have to move on . but what scott brown did today was unbelievable . he showed today what a player he is . ' deila meantime believes his side fully merited their step towards his target of a domestic treble and said : ` it is a great feeling . ` it is good to get a good start when you are the manager in a big club such as celtic and this was the first trophy we could win . we did it and you get an appetite from this . ` you want more and i am happy for the boys and proud of them . i think we put in a professional performance . you should really enjoy this moment . john guidetti ( left ) celebrates james forrest 's strike for the hoops as they beat dundee united ` you can never rest on what you have done before . ` we have talked about the treble many times and it is a dream . it is so tough to do it , but it is possible and the dream is still alive . we have one trophy and we have to be back again on wednesday if we are to win another cup trophy .

the lib dems could creep back into government even if they lose half of their mps , senior figures close to nick clegg have claimed . publicly the party has boasted that it will fare better than disastrous polling ratings suggest , but privately the leadership fears it could be reduced to just 30 mps , compared to the 57 it won in 2010 . but insiders suggest this could be enough to put them back in power , most probably with the conservatives . mr clegg will use his speech to his party conference in liverpool today to insist the lib dems ` are here to stay ' . in some recent polls the party has been as low as just 5 per cent , with predictions of big losses against labour in the north of england and the snp in scotland . liberal democrat leader nick clegg during a q&a session at the party 's spring conference yesterday . he will use his speech today to insist the lib dems ` are here to stay ' jo swinson , parliamentary under-secretary of state for employment relations , consumer and postal affairs and women and equalities ( left ) and chief secretary to the treasury danny alexander ( right ) during their speeches at the liverpool arena minister of state for care and support norman lamb addresses the conference hall on merseyside but mr clegg will insist : ` i 've heard the predictions . i 've seen the polls . but let me tell you this : we will do so much better than anyone thinks . ` in those seats where we are out in force , making our case loudly and proudly , we are the ones making the political weather . ' but privately the mood is less upbeat . senior lib dems admit the election will be ` really tough ' and as many as half of their mps will be ousted . in a bizarre twist they claim this could still be enough to put the party back in government , and keep mr clegg as deputy pm . former liberal democrat leader paddy ashdown at conference . the party could be reduced to just 30 mps danny alexander ( left ) and business secretary vince cable ( right ) . in some recent polls the lib dems have polled as low as just 5 per cent , with predictions of big losses against labour in the north of england jo swinson during her speech . senior lib dems admit the coming election will be ` really tough ' for the party it is suggested that if the tories fall between 10 and 30 seats short of a majority , a deal could be done . however , a power-sharing agreement with labour looks less and less likely . a source said : ` reaching 325 is the key . if the tories have 295 then we would be the ones to get them to that number . ` around 30 would be enough . i ca n't see any way in which labour forms the largest party . everything is in favour of the tories . ` it is going to be really tough . to get 40 seats would be amazing but 30 could still put us back in government . ' taking questions from activists at the conference yesterday , mr clegg was challenged over why the party 's polls ratings were so bad and how they could be improved . jo swinson and nick clegg cast their votes . taking questions from activists , mr clegg was challenged over why the party 's polls ratings were so bad and how they could be improved danny alexander rallies the troops . a lib dem power-sharing agreement with labour is looking unlikely he joked that he was open to suggestions , adding ` answers on a postcard please ' . the lib dems have never recovered from breaking their flagship promise to scrap tuition fees which has dogged mr clegg throughout the five years of the coalition . those close to the leader say he has been punished by the tories for compromising for the coalition , but the larger party has not been hit in the same way . ` we have never properly punished the tories for something , we have never made them eat crow , ' said a source . it is thought many in the party now wish they had halted and then scrapped the controversial health reforms which were paused but later passed by the two parties .
defending champions india sealed their place in the world cup knockout stages with a nervy run chase against west indies in perth . captain mahendra singh dhoni helped to steer his team to a four-wicket victory in a low-scoring pool b match . india , who bowled the windies out for 182 , therefore remain one of two unbeaten teams in the tournament - co-hosts new zealand are the other - after scrambling the verdict with 10.5 overs to spare on a typically bouncy pitch at the waca . mahendra singh dhoni is congratulated by west indies captain chris gayle after india 's four-wicket win the india captain hit an unbeaten knock of 45 as india chased down the target of 183 in the world cup game west indies were hapless in the first 10 overs , after winning the toss on a glorious afternoon , and might have been bowled out even more cheaply but for four dropped catches by india and captain jason holder 's second successive half-century from number nine . dwayne smith struggled badly against india 's new-ball pair , eventually edging behind off mohammad shami ( three for 35 ) . chris gayle was out of sorts too , dropped twice and then holing out to a mis-pull off shami - but not before a mix-up with marlon samuels saw the windies number three run out for just two . captain denesh ramdin could not halt the slide , aiming an expansive cover-drive to a swinging low full-toss first ball and instead edging on to umesh yadav . lendl simmons and jonathan carter almost doubled the score until the former fell pulling mohit sharma to deep backward-square . darren sammy was dropped by ravindra jadeja on five , when he mistimed a skier into the off-side ring off mohit . india players celebrate after mohamed shami dismisses darren sammy of west indies chris gayle was n't able to get into his stride on friday , despite this unsuccessful appear from shami andre russell was soon gone instead , hitting jadeja 's first ball straight to long-off . but sammy stayed long enough to help holder ( 57 ) shepherd the windies into powerplay , before he was caught-behind off the returning shami . the captain struck four fours and three sixes from 64 balls but was last out , another hitting jadeja to long-off , with almost six overs unused . two wickets in an impressive new-ball spell from jerome taylor gave the windies renewed hope , both openers going as shikhar dhawan was caught at second slip and rohit sharma edged an attempted drive behind . virat kohli threatened to shorten the chase until he hooked russell into the hands of samuels - and when ajinkya rahane went to a marginal drs verdict , caught-behind off kemar roach , india had lost four wickets with more than 100 runs still needed . suresh raina struggled against the short ball before edging a cut behind off smith 's medium-pace , and the same tactic from russell saw jadeja pull russell to a juggling samuels . but dhoni engineered an unbroken match-winning half-century stand with ravi ashwin and finished top-scorer with 45 not out in a curious contest which contained 47 extras . virat kohli drives the ball through the covers as he threatened to shorten the chase in perth
as chris smalling continues his efforts to convince louis van gaal he is worth another contract at manchester united , he is safe in the knowledge roy hodgson has always admired his qualities , ever since a chance first encounter . hodgson signed smalling from non-league maidstone united , seven years ago , soon after les reed , fulham 's director of football , had invited the 18-year-old centre-half along to a trial at the club 's training ground in surrey . ` he was watching by chance and he pulled me into his office and it all started from there , ' said smalling . ' i ca n't remember the whole conversation , it 's a bit of a blur , but roy was very encouraging . chris smalling ( centre ) in action during an england training session at st georges park smalling is thankful for hodgson and is delighted they can rekindle their relationship at england ` he mentioned in conversation that he 'd played for maidstone . i did n't know many other people who had played for maidstone . ' i came back for a week to train with the reserves , and was offered a contract a month or so later . he 's the one who really got it started for me and it 's nice to rekindle that with england . i hope my performances for my club help him to keep selecting me . ' hodgson , who played for maidstone in the early 70s , convinced smalling he had a career in professional football , although the youngster decided to complete his a-levels first . the defender has become a key player for manchester united this season alongside phil jones there were university places on offer to study financial economics at leicester or loughborough if he secured three bs in his exams , which he did . ' i was planning to go to university but a month or two before my exams i was offered trials by fulham and middlesbrough , ' said smalling . ' i had nothing to lose and gave it my all . ` i 'd been at millwall until i was about 15 . it was quite far to travel and i was missing some sessions , so i was n't really developing , and then i went to maidstone . ' hodgson signed smalling when he was fulham boss from non-league side maidstone united his education did little to impress van gaal , earlier this season , when the manchester united boss branded smalling ` stupid ' for a red card , during the first half of the derby against city . ' i was foolish , and it was a rush of blood , ' said smalling . ` you learn more from yourself than from what managers and fans say . it 's something i 've not done too often and hopefully it wo n't happen again . i 've learnt not to get caught up in these situations . i try not to clock up too many cards , but that was a moment of madness . ' the same could be said for his decision to attend a fancy dress party last year in a jager-bomber costume , with an arabian headscarf , shades , a flak-jacket and bottles of jagermeister and red bull strapped to his body . after being close to going to university , smalling is now an england international and trophy winner ` there 's always people out there that are trying to pick you up , and as a role model for young players you have to make sure you 're on the ball , ' he said . ` that 's something you only learn as you get older . ` it 's more a case of common sense really , but there are older players there if you do need some advice . it was one of those things . there are a lot of things that happen that sometimes get blown up . in general that 's rare for me . ' niggling injuries have proved more disruptive since he left fulham for old trafford in 2010 , but he is back in the team and has delivered some impressive performances as van gaal 's united started to click . smalling of england speaks to the media during the england press conference at the grove hotel he was excellent in the win at liverpool , frustrating mario balotelli in the process , and was looking forward to another duel with the striker in turin until he discovered balotelli has been omitted from the squad for the friendly against england . ` if you 're doing your job and not giving the striker much of a chance he 'll probably get angry , and balotelli is someone who can lose his temper very quickly , ' said smalling . ` if i 'm shutting down the striker , i 'm happy to see them get frustrated . ' i thought it could be round two on tuesday , but i 've seen he 's not in the squad so we 'll have to wait for that . ' the defender enjoyed winding up mario balotelli and was disappointed to not see him in italy 's squad smalling 's good form offered encouragement to those who believe the 25-year-old may yet prove to be a long-term successor to rio ferdinand . ` i 've been able to clock up a run of games in the past few months , ' he said . ` the manager has shown a lot of faith in me and i 've been able to stay fit . it ' s nice to get a good run , it helps you become more confident and to put your personality on the game . ` rio was a defender i really admired for the way he put his character and personality onto the pitch . he 's not just your everyday defender . you can see his character in the way he wants to play football . that 's something young players can pick up on . rio ferdinand was a major influence on smalling and he admired the way that he played the game ` when i joined it was a case of playing with him for a good few years and picking up a lot of points . eventually when he did move on i felt i was ready and it was an opportunity for me to show myself . ` when you have the shirt , everyone else is fighting it out and trying to push you out of the way . when that time comes you need to make sure you 're in a good run of form so the manager feels you are the one who should step in . ' the process has been complicated since by injuries , managerial changes at old trafford , his own versatility and van gaal 's habit of switching between three and four at the back . with champions league qualification close to being secured , the defender can look forward to europe ` i 've not had too many different managers and this is my first foreign coach , ' said smalling . ` he 's really worked hard on the training field right from the double sessions in pre-season . we 've had the tactics , and quite a lot of meetings in terms of the vision he wants . ` he wants more from the centre-halves on the ball , rather than taking the easy option and passing to the full-back when the room is too narrow that they ca n't really do much with the ball . ` the manager does stress why pass it to him when you 've got no-one marking you . i am enjoying that responsibility . sir alex wanted us to play out , but there 's more emphasis on that now . louis van gaal ( left ) and sir alex ferguson have very different styles of management says smalling ` growing up , first of all you 're a defender but we have more possession than a lot of teams and we have to be a bit more like the midfield and start moves . ' smalling 's contract expires next year . as someone who had the chance to study financial economics , you might think he would be all over the details , but he is in no rush . ` it 's not something i really want to focus on , ' he said . ` it 's not really come into my head . i 'm enjoying it at united . i 'm focusing on the rest of the season . i 'm happy as ever because i 'm playing and hopefully i can keep contributing .

anti-slavery activist harriet tubman , who could be set to be the first female to feature on a us banknote an escaped slave who helped to free others from their captors could be set to become the first female face on a u.s. banknote . a campaign has been gathering pace to replace former president andrew jackson on $ 20 bills with that of a female for the first time in history . an online petition has now been set up with site visitors asked to vote for which female historical figure should feature on the bill . and it seems that illiterate black woman harriet tubman is leading the way to be nominated as the new face before the petition is formally handed over to president barack obama . the petition has been set up on the website womenon20s.org , which is calling for jackson to be replaced due to his negative treatment of native americans . a 15-strong shortlist has been drawn up , which includes tubman , who was born into slavery in 1822 in maryland . in 1849 she escaped her owners , fleeing north and then subsequently made several missions to rescue friends and family , who remained enslaved , by using a network of safehouses known as the underground network . after the american civil war she continued to be an advocate for education and joined early campaigns for women 's equality and suffrage . others on the list include rosa parks , whose refusal to give up her seat on a bus sparked the modern civil rights movement and eleanor roosevelt , a former first lady . the faces on american bank notes have remained the same since 1929 , but president obama has signalled he would be open to change . civil rights activist rosa parks , left , and former first lady eleanor roosevelt , who are also on the shortlist to appear on the $ 20 bill currently , the $ 20 bill features the face of seventh us president andrew jackson , who became much maligned due to this treatment of native americans the campaign , is hoping that if it is successful , a note featuring a woman would go into circulation by 2020 . petition organiser barbara ortiz howard told cbs : ` there are no women on the money and i thought gee this is a crazy omission . ' the petition mirrors a similar campaign in the uk to get jane austen as the face of a # 10 note after a public outcry that every banknote featured a man . the bank of england governor mark carney unveiled the new design as a tribute to ` one of the greatest writers in english literature ' which will appear from 2017 , replacing naturalist charles darwin . a similar campaign in the uk will see a # 10 note , pictured , with the face of author jane austen on it go into circulation in 2017 the announcement was hailed as a ` brilliant day for women ' by journalist cristina criado-perez , who had led a high-profile campaign on social media to ensure a female face would remain on banknotes after the bank dropped social reformer elizabeth fry from the # 5 note in favour of winston churchill . but days later she began receiving a stream of abuse from 86 twitter accounts . arts college graduate isabella sorley , 23 , and unemployed recluse john nimmo , 25 were jailed after threatening to kill and rape miss criado-perez for her campaign .
it is the largest cave in the world , with its own sheer rocky cliffs , jungle-like vegetation and climate . so it is no wonder photographer ryan deboodt , 31 , relied on a drone to capture footage showing the immense size of the hang son doong cave in vietnam . the result is a spectacular video showcasing the dramatic topography inside the cave , which is 5.5 miles long , 650ft wide and 500ft tall . opening with shots pan across the vast jungle-like vegetation and adventurers are traipsing through the cave are dwarfed by their immense surroundings . ryan , originally from america but now living in beijing , china , described the cave as like an extraterrestrial planet . he said : ` this was my third visit to son doong . it was actually last minute that i even decided to take the drone in with me . ' i was originally going in to the cave to collect three timelapse cameras i had in there for six months to document the flooding . ' the process took ryan eight days to complete and he was required to take a lot of ropes , harnesses and safety equipment into the cave with him . the drone captures the staggering height of the cave and people in the images appear to be specks on the landscape a time lapse shot captures a beam of sun light moving through the top of the cave over the course of a day outside shots of the cave show the magnitude of it and capture the grand scale of its reported 500ft tourists with a spare # 1,800 ( $ 3,000 ) can take tours of the cave with a company called oxalis . a team of more than 25 porters , safety experts and guides take the tour over six days . the journey to the cave takes a day and a half through dense uninhabited jungle , before you abseil 260ft down to its entrance . tours must be booked in advance as there is a strict limit of 10 guests per departure . he said : ` throughout the entire cave you have to be extra cautious , as something as simple as a twisted ankle can cause much grief and effort in order to get back out of the cave . ' ryan explained that while he was within the cave he would n't have been surprised to have seen a dinosaur . he said : ` being inside son doong is absolutely unreal . i felt tiny , insignificant . ' the cave was first discovered in 1991 , when a local farmer stumbled across it and sought shelter there from a storm . before the chance discovery , it had remained undetected beneath the annamite mountains in a remote part of central vietnam for millions of years . unable to find the cave again on a repeat visit , the farmer gave up the hunt until he was approached by a group of cavers to help him find it . the colossal underground network of tunnels was discovered in 2009 and officially named the world 's largest cave . a natural staircase covered in greenery is captured up-close and explorers can be seen climbing them the cave was first discovered in 1991 by a local farmer and is five times the size of malaysia 's deer cave a number of shots capture beams of sun light and the vast jungle-like vegetation that grows inside the cave the name ` son doong ' cave means ` mountain river cave ' . it was created 2-5 million years ago by river water eroding away the limestone underneath the mountain where the limestone was weak , the ceiling collapsed creating huge skylights . the mesmerising six-minute-long video presents the different parts of the underground world , from the harsh and jagged rocks to the lush greenery and the cave 's own lake and river . a timelapse shot captures the sun filtering through one of the many sinkholes which allows natural light in to illuminated the hidden underground world . ryan deboodt 's photography can be found on his website and instagram page , and the original video can be viewed here . it is estimated that the cave was created around two-five million years ago by river water eroding limestone underneath a mountain
a controversial spanish aquarium trainer who was accused of abusing dolphins has been found dead following a suspected suicide . jose luis barbero , 59 , who was due to arrive in the us to work at the georgia aquarium at the beginning of march believed to have taken his own life in spain after he started receiving death threats when video emerged of him apparently kicking and hitting the animals . the 59-year-old was working on the resort island of mallorca in the mediterranean sea when he vanished on friday after the damning footage surfaced . dolphin trainer jose luis barbero , who was just hired by the georgia aquarium in atlanta , has been found dead in spain following a suspected suicide before he vanished , videos of barbero , 59 , ( rear ) allegedly hitting and kicking dolphins surfaced on the internet after the videos ( pictured above ) started popping up on the web , barbero began receiving death threats a statement from management at the atlanta attraction sent to fox 5 following his death paid tribute to the expert trainer and accused people of rushing to judge him . ` it was with sadness , outrage and frustration that i received the news this morning that jose luis barbero was found dead in spain . ` initial reports suggest that he allegedly ended his own life . he was a husband , a father and a grandfather who dedicated nearly four decades to caring for animals . we at georgia aquarium were proud to have had him serve periodically as a consultant to our organization over the past eight years . his service with us was exemplary . ` after allegations were levied against him , we took the situation very seriously . georgia aquarium began a search for truth in hopes of disproving these unsubstantiated claims . ` sadly , he and his family received death threats , and groups and individuals rushed to judge him . he was not given the right or the privilege to be considered innocent until proven guilty , a principle i hold dear . his death is untimely , unnecessary and unjust . ` we were not given the chance to thoughtfully and thoroughly review the allegations against him before activists , consultants and some in our own community tortured him with enough hatred to cause him to allegedly take his own life . ' i hope the death of jose luis barbero teaches those who were quick to condemn him a lesson about being hasty to charge and indict . ` we will continue to operate georgia aquarium with dedication , devotion and pride in how we care for and about our animals -- as well as the people affiliated with our organization . we will continue to serve the community and be advocates for animals around the world , as we have done since our founding . we will never condone any injustice , such as the one done to jose luis barbero . ` we mourn with his family , his friends and all those who must contend with this terrible loss . ' a former fbi agent was also hired by the georgia aquarium to travel to spain as part of the investigation officials from the atlanta attraction have issued a statement defending barbero and accused his critics of being too quick to judge him barbero went missing before another video accusing him of abusing dolphins was released on friday , according to11 alive . he was last seen on tuesday leaving his home , wsb tv reported . balearic islands emergency services are continuing to search for him . georgia aquarium ceo mike leven said , ` we are very concerned . ` we hope he turns up soon and that everything is all right . our thoughts are with him and his family . ' according to leven , barbero received death threats after the videos surfaced . the embattled trainer did respond to the videos on facebook . in a translated post he said : ' i believe a response is needed to this brutal and cowardly campaign against my profession . ' i can only say from my lawyers ' recommendations that this video is a montage created to provoke a campaign challenging my professionalism over 35 years . ' barbero of spain went missing before another video accusing him of abusing dolphins was released yesterday the most recent video allegedly shows barbero being aggressive towards dolphins during a training session at a theme park in spain . animal advocacy group sosdelfines said the videos are ` meant to show how captive dolphins are treated ' , according to the dodo . the aquarium has questioned whether the videos of barbero are authentic and used the terms ` extremely questionable ' and ` crudely edited ' to describe them . aquarium leaders claimed to have ` thoroughly reviewed and vetted ' barbero as a candidate and also cited that he has 35 years of professional experience . experts were brought in to analyze the content of the videos . a former fbi agent was also hired by the aquarium to travel to spain as part of the investigation . it is unclear what barbero 's job status is at the moment , but he it appears he is still a consultant and not a full-time employee of the aquarium . the georgia aquarium maintains that it has a zero tolerance policy against the mistreatment of animals animal advocacy group sosdelfines said the videos are ` meant to show how captive dolphins are treated ' the aquarium released a statement about the barbero investigation on friday afternoon . it said : ` our search for truth into the allegations against jose luis barbero continues . ` until our investigation is complete , we will not make any decisions regarding his employment , so at this time , mr. barbero remains in spain . ` we are committed to making decisions based on factual information and very thorough analysis . ` we have a zero tolerance policy against the mistreatment of animals and continue to investigate every aspect of this matter . ` we appreciate your patience and support as we sort through this difficult situation . ' it seems that barbero is still a consultant and not a full-time employee of the aquarium at this time
he is notorious for remaining tight-lipped about his personal life in interviews . and last night davis cup team-mate dominic inglot must have hoped andy murray would extend the same privacy to his fellow players . asked by eurosport presenter annabel croft how the team would celebrate following victory over the united states , murray was quick to point out that his 29-year-old team-mate has a ` little girlfriend on the go here in glasgow ' . murray , far left , with anabel croft , his brother jamie , centre , and a mortifies dominic inglot tweet : dominic inglot appeared eager to set the record straight on twitter following murray 's joke unfortunately for inglot , he already has a girlfriend of six months at home in london . when asked for the name of the lady in question , a mortified inglot replied : ` you 've actually landed me in this . because i actually have a girlfriend that 's going to be watching this . ' the jokey stitch-up left murray in hysterics as the team sheepishly shuffled away from the disastrous interview . a source close to the team last night explained that murray was unaware inglot has a girlfriend in london and did not know that the joke would backfire on his team mate . but a spokesperson for the lawn tennis association last night dismissed the stitch-up as ` pure banter ' . laura lord of the lta said it was ` just a bunch of guys messing around ' . inglot , from chiswick , was only playing his second davis cup match and , as a specialist in doubles , is not someone murray habitually spends much time with although they are friends . great britain yesterday celebrated a 3-2 victory over the us to reach the quarter finals of the davis cup . above , murray celebrates during the first round tie of the davis cup last night he was said to be seeing the funny side of it after smoothing things over with his girlfriend , who has not been named . inglot was not out celebrating last night in glasgow but flew straight back to london with team mates as he is due to fly out to play in america tomorrow . great britain yesterday celebrated a 3-1 victory over the usa to reach the quarter finals of the davis cup .
a star that is travelling fast enough to escape the gravitational clutches of our galaxy has been discovered by a team of astronomers . the amazing stellar object attained its rapid speed when a nearby star exploded as a supernova , sending it out of the milky way . at its current speed it would make the journey from earth to the moon in just five minutes - a trip which took the apollo spacecraft three days . scroll down for a video showing an artist 's impression of the event astronomers in hawaii have found the fastest ` unbound ' star in the galaxy . called us 708 it is moving at 745 miles ( 1,200 km ) per second . it will leave the galaxy in about 25 million years . this artist 's concept shows a star ( left ) being ejected from the galaxy , although in reality the supernova would have been faded long ago the star , known as us 708 , was first discovered in 1982 by dr peter usher of pennsylvania state university but had since then remained ignored . however , a team of astronomers led by the university of hawaii at manoa has now re-examined the star , and found that it breaks the galactic speed record for an ` unbound ' star . us 708 is almost 62,000 light-years from earth , and is on a path that will take it out of the milky way in about 25 million years . type 1a : a white dwarf accumulates material from a stellar companion until it undergoes runaway nuclear fusion and explodes . non-standard type 1a : two white dwarfs merge until their combined mass causes an explosion . type ii : a star at least nine times the mass of the sun eventually experiences a core collapse as its fuel runs out , causing it to explode . type 1b and 1c : a star undergoes core collapse but most of its outer hydrogen has already been lost to stellar winds . hypernova : extreme type of supernova , 50 times as energetic as other supernovas , resulting in a black hole . the exact cause of them is unknown . using the 10-metre keck ii and pan-starrs1 telescopes in hawaii , the astronomers calculated that the star is moving at about 745 miles ( 1,200 km ) per second . this makes it the fastest ` rogue ' star in the galaxy - one that is no longer orbiting the centre . ` at that speed , you could travel from earth to the moon in five minutes , ' said dr eugene magnier of the university of hawaii at manoa . ` by observing the sky repeatedly over several years , the pan-starrs1 survey , let us make a movie of the motions of the stars in the sky . ` that enables us to study the behavioirs of extremely rare and weird stars like us 708 . ' while a handful of other stars escaping the galaxy are known , this is the first to have been found that was ejected by a thermonuclear supernova explosion . us 708 , which is a helium-rich white dwarf , was propelled at high speeds when a more massive white dwarf star nearby in a tight binary blew up . at the speed us 708 is travelling it would make the journey from earth to the moon in just five minutes - a trip which took the apollo astronauts three days . pictured is the view of earth seen by the apollo 8 crew as they circled the moon in december 1968 this particular class of supernova is known as type 1a , where material is transferred between one star and another until one reaches a critical mass , and explodes . often , the secondary star is obliterated in the resulting explosion , or pushed away at a more sedate speed . it is ` pushed ' away because the loss of its companion means it no longer has a star to orbit , but retains its forwards momentum , so it is flung into space . the specific characteristics of this binary system , its distance and the mass of its companion , allowed us 708 to remain intact while still achieving record speeds for an unbound star . stars like the sun are bound to our galaxy by its gravity , and orbit its centre at relatively moderate velocities , typically tens to a few hundreds of kilometres per second . only so-called hyperveolocity stars are known to travel so fast that they are unbound to the galaxy . us 708 , which is a helium-rich white dwarf , was propelled at high speeds when a more massive white dwarf star nearby in a tight binary blew up ( illustration shown ) . it is the first star found to be leaving the galaxy caused by such an event , and could provide an insight into these types of supernova in addition , to escape from the milky way an object needs to exceed the ` escape velocity ' - the strength of its gravitational pull . the escape velocity of our galaxy is about 375 miles ( 600km ) per second , which us 708 easily exceeds . astronomers hope that studying the star could help reveal how such helium-rich stars and thermonuclear supernovae are linked .
the uk is to supply a further package of non-lethal military equipment worth # 850,000 as a gift to the government of ukraine , it has been announced . defence secretary michael fallon said the package will include first aid kits , night vision goggles , helmets , gps ( global positioning system ) units and ` ruggedised ' laptops . the announcement comes a day after foreign secretary philip hammond flew to the eastern european country 's capital kiev for talks with ukraine 's president petro poroshenko , prime minister arseniy yatsenyuk and foreign minister pavlo klimkin . defence secretary michael fallon said the uk is sending more non-lethal aid to ukraine in a written statement to the house of commons , mr fallon said that the uk 's gift came in response to a request from kiev for help with basic equipment , supplies of which have been depleted by months of instability caused by russian-backed separatists in the east of the country . mr fallon said : ` this government is committed to supporting ukraine 's sovereignty , independence and territorial integrity . as a result of their prolonged engagement in this conflict , the ukrainians face a serious shortage of basic equipment , and have requested help . ` our proposed gift of non-lethal equipment is designed to prevent further ukrainian fatalities and casualties and to help improve situational awareness on the ground . ' and he added : ' russia 's illegal annexation of crimea and its destabilising activities in eastern ukraine , including direct military support to the separatists , have demonstrated its disregard for international law . ` the latest ceasefire agreement , reached in minsk on february 12 and which came into force on february 15 , has seen a reduction in violence in the conflict zone . we very much hope it will help end the conflict . ` however , fighting has not ceased in some areas and there continues to be fatalities and casualties amongst the ukrainian armed forces . ' the gift comes after kiev asks britain for help with basic equipment . pictured : ukrainian paratroopers taking part in drill
despite the rather clunky acronym , mitsubishi 's outlander phev has been a runaway success on the quiet . though not cheap , at up to # 40,000 , they 're selling like hot cakes -- largely as a company car because of the massive tax advantages . now there 's good news for those whose budgets ca n't stretch to one , because there 's to be a smaller , mid-size sibling . the prototype xr-phev ( plug-in electric vehicle ) ii is a compact , lightweight suv powered by a new hybrid electric system . clearly aimed at top-selling nissan qashqai country , expect prices either side of # 20,000 when the production model hits the market in a couple of years ' time . mitsubishi 's xr-phev ( plug-in electric vehicle ) ii ( pictured ) will cost up to # 40,000 ( prototype pictured ) mitsubishi says of its baby phev : ` the system is estimated to achieve very low co2 emissions of below 40g/km while also delivering gutsy and smooth performance with its 163bhp electric motor . ' it adds that it is developing plug-in electric hybrid systems best suited to each model in its line-up with a view to introducing them in the near future . the outlander phev can be charged overnight at home , run on electric-only power or operate in hybrid mode , switching automatically between petrol and electric power , depending on which is most efficient . it continues to charge itself as it runs on fossil fuel . the result is great fuel economy and low co2 emissions . but its real benefit -- and one secret of its success -- is on the tax front . it would be chancellor george osborne 's worst nightmare if everybody had one , as his tax take would plummet . here 's why : bought outright privately , the outlander phev costs # 28,249 to # 39,999 , which includes a taxpayer subsidy of # 5,000 . but company car drivers can look forward to an increase in their pay packet equal to an average of more than # 4,000 every year , says mitsubishi . its twolitre petrol engine linked to two high-efficiency electric motors gives a combined range of 510 miles , of which 32.5 miles can be in pure electric mode . average co2 emissions are a tiny 44g/km and combined fuel efficiency is 148 mpg . but here 's the rub , get one as a company car and you pay just 5 per cent ` benefit in kind ' tax , compared to the 25 per cent that most business users pay . so , for example , a 40 per cent taxpayer with an outlander phev gx4h with a p11d taxable benefits value of # 37,899 will pay just # 758 in company car tax . that compares to # 4,301 for a honda crv ec 2.2 i-dtec auto costing # 33,605 , which is taxed at 32 per cent of its p11d value . that 's equivalent to a tax saving of # 3,543 over a year or # 10,730 over three . the new prototype 's big brother is the mitsubishi outlander phev ( pictured ) plus , its low co2 emissions mean you are exempt from road tax -- and in london , the congestion charge , too . there 's a benefit for firms , too , notes mitsubishi : ' a company purchasing an outlander phev is able to write down 100 per cent of the cost of the car against its profits chargeable for corporation tax in year one . ` this is compared to a traditional company vehicle where a maximum of 18 per cent per annum of the cost is allowable to write down against the profits chargeable for corporation tax . ` this means any business with even a small fleet could save tens of thousands of pounds in corporation tax in the first year . ' less than a year on from its uk launch last april , mitsubishi has sold more than 10,000 outlander phevs . it 's overtaken every other plug-in hybrid and pure electric car , even passing vehicles that have been on sale since 2011 , such as the nissan leaf , to become the uk 's favourite plug-in vehicle , says mitsubishi . its uk managing director lance bradley adds : ` this is a satisfying achievement , but more significantly indicates this newly developing market is beginning to decide which electric vehicle technology delivers the right balance of low emissions , value , economy and practicality . ' seat 's 20v20 crossover concept car is pictured at the 85th international motor show in geneva 2015 seat has also jumped on to the growing sports utility bandwagon with a sporty off-roader shown at geneva . the company , part of german giant volkswagen group , is understood to be planning three crossover or suv-style vehicles -- with at least one gunning for nissan 's qashqai -- dubbed the cash cow for the profits it 's earned for nissan . seat 's chief executive juergen stackmann said : ` this is the first step in a family of suvs . the car is a lighthouse for our brand . ' expect this look to carry through on models launched from 2016 to 2020 . you do n't have to be a member to attend this year 's 73rd members ' meeting at goodwood next weekend , where drivers including take that 's howard donald , pink floyd drummer nick mason and singer-songwriter chris rea of road to hell fame will be racing . for the first time the earl of march is opening the event to non-members . the biggest party ever held at goodwood is also promised . the aim is to recreate the excitement of the british automobile racing club ( barc ) held at goodwood from 1949 to 1966 .

eoin collins , five , eats anything from stones to fabric conditioner due to a rare disorder a five-year-old boy eats everything from stones , sand , soil and mortar to toilet paper , sponge , paint and fabric conditioner due to a rare disorder . eoin collins , from chester , has an impulsive and untreatable craving disorder called pica - a appetite for non-food substances . he was diagnosed three years ago when he started to chew on sand from the beach in cornwall during a family holiday . his insatiable appetite means he consumes cleaning products , wallpaper and has even started to chew on his nine-year-old brother finn 's comic relief red nose . his disorder keeps his single mother-of-three ceri collins on her toes and she has to watch him constantly to keep him from eating something that could make him seriously ill . mrs collins , 32 , a childminder , said : ` you ca n't turn your back on him for a second without him sticking his hand in the sand or mud . ` if i leave cleaning products out for a second then he will eat them or try to drink them and he 's always picking paint off the walls . ` and i had to give a plant that a friend gave to me as a present to my mum because he was always at the soil . ` he will eat literally anything . ' eoin has picked paint off the walls all around their home and risks eating his way through to his grandmother 's house next door . mrs collins has to keep all potentially fatal products on the top shelf and even uses stair gates to keep her son out of cupboards . recently , eoin has developed a taste for sponges and even toilet paper - and his cravings show no sign of stopping . she said : ' i just thought that it was a phase and that he would grow out of it when i first saw him eat sand . ` the real danger is that he will eat something that will make him sick . ` but thankfully that has n't happened yet and he 's not gained weight . ` but eoin has limited speech so he ca n't tell me why he does it at all and it 's really stressful . ' pica , the latin word for ` magpie ' , is most common in people with learning disabilities and during pregnancy . it can cause a range of serious complications if the person is eating something that is poisonous or indigestible . they can also damage their teeth , or have part of the body obstructed -- something often seen in people who eat hair . eoin drives his mother crazy by eating paint and mortar from the walls of his home . recently , he has developed cravings for toilet paper and sponges pica is an eating disorder that is characterised by the desire to eat items with little or no nutritional value . these can include stones , sand , paint and dirt . it is most common in people with learning disabilities and during pregnancy . it can cause a range of serious complications if the person is eating something that is poisonous or indigestible . these include being poisoned by toxic ingredients and having a part of the body obstructed ( which is often seen in people who eat hair ) . it can also lead to excessive calorie intake , but also nutritional deprivation if the person eats a substance with no nutritional value instead of nutritious foods . the person can also damage their teeth and be infected with parasites . it can lead to weight gain if they are consuming more calories , or a deficiency ff they are replacing nutritious food with substances with no nutritional value . eoin has one-on-one assistance at broughton primary school in chester to keep him from eating bizarre items when he is away from his mother . but he has to be watched like a hawk when he visits friends ' houses as he will . mrs collins said : ` his cravings can be horrendous some weeks and when he goes to people 's houses he sometimes goes straight to the little drawer in their washing machine to scoop up the fabric conditioner . ' eoin has a brother , finn , nine , and sister niamh , two , who are not affected by his bizarre cravings . mrs collins said : ` both his brother and sister are brilliant with him . ` niamh will sometimes try and copy him and start eating bubbles in the bath and stuff like that . ceri collins , 32 , has to supervise her son constantly as she is terrified he will eat something harmful ` but at least she does n't like the taste - eoin is not bothered by taste at all and he ca n't help the urge . ' i do n't know what it is - whether it is the texture or something else - but i just have to try and distract him to stop him eating things he should n't . ' eoin 's cravings - especially for mud and moss - have made it difficult for him to go outside to play and last summer , he was stuck indoors . mrs collins is now fundraising to raise # 8,000 to create a garden of ` non-edible ' materials . it will enable him to play outside without close supervision which he needs to prevent him from hunting down his favourite ` food ' - moss . mrs collins said : ` he will get more freedom when he goes outside which is really important - it will be a massive step for his independence . ` he loves to be outside and people have been really kind by donating things and raising money for the new garden . ` he 's a rascal but is really loving . unfortunately he ca n't go outside on his own much because of the condition but hopefully that is about to change .
rayhanur choudhury has been jailed for theft after he was believed to have swallowed a diamond ring a thief has been jailed after he is believed to have swallowed an # 8,500 chunky diamond ring when arrested by police . officers said they saw rayhanur choudhury with a silver ` glint ' in his mouth when they went to arrest him after being called to exclusive jewellery in brighton . the 22-year-old was fed five or six meals a day in a police cell with no flushing toilet in a bid to get him to pass the ring , which was fully set with emerald-cut diamonds . however nothing has been found . he was convicted of theft and jailed for nine months , following a hearing at brighton crown court . police were called to the store in november last year after choudhury started trying on rings while staff were distracted . lilly jordan , a shop assistant , suspected he had swapped the 18-carat white gold ring for a fake alternative . she told the court : ' i counted the rings and there were five but one seemed out of place . ` it stuck out like a sore thumb .

' cctv footage showed choudhury tilt his head back during the struggle with police . pc english said : ` he opened his mouth wide and i saw briefly the distinctive glint of something inside . ' i believe i saw something silver , an object that should n't have been there . ' choudhury , of newhaven , east sussex , denied the theft and the ring was never found . the ring was taken from exclusive jewellery in brighton as choudhury browsed the jewellery on display he told the court he had explained to officers he was unwell so he could have an x-ray at hospital to prove he had not swallowed the ring . alec williams , prosecuting , said : ` it 's a straightforward , not particularly sophisticated con trick , a switch . ' choudhury was also ordered to pay a # 100 victim surcharge .

( cnn ) germanwings co-pilot andreas lubitz was hiding an illness from his employers and had been declared " unfit to work " by a doctor , according to german authorities investigating what could have prompted the seemingly competent and stable pilot to steer his jetliner into a french mountain . investigators found a letter in the waste bin of his dusseldorf , germany , apartment saying that lubitz , 27 , was n't fit to do his job , city prosecutor christoph kumpa said friday . the note , kumpa said , had been " slashed . " just what was ailing lubitz has n't been revealed . the new york times and the wall street journal , citing unnamed sources , reported friday that lubitz suffered from mental illness and kept his diagnosis concealed from his employer . a dusseldorf clinic said he 'd gone there twice , most recently 17 days ago , " concerning a diagnosis . " but the university clinic said it had not treated lubitz for depression . german investigators said they still have interviews and other work to do before they 'll be able to reveal just what they found in the records in lubitz 's apartment in a quiet , suburban neighborhood . they found no goodbye note or confession , authorities said . but the fact that investigators found " ripped , recent medical leave notes , including for the day of the offense , leads to the preliminary conclusion that the deceased kept his illness secret from his employer and his professional environment , " prosecutors said . authorities left lubitz 's apartment friday night with boxes of papers and evidence folders after spending about 90 minutes inside . according to authorities in germany and france , lubitz was a co-pilot on germanwings flight 9525 between barcelona , spain , and dusseldorf on tuesday when he apparently locked the captain out of the cockpit , then activated a control causing the plane to descend toward rugged terrain . germanwings said the plane dropped for about eight minutes from its cruising altitude of 38,000 feet before crashing . the only sounds , authorities said , were those of pounding on the cockpit door , lubitz 's steady breathing and , eventually , screaming passengers . lubitz and 149 other people on board the plane died in an instant , authorities say . mother , daughter among 3 american victims what could have prompted lubitz to deliberately destroy the aircraft , killing everyone on board , remained the focus of investigators in germany . officials said lubitz was not known to be on any terrorism list , and his religion was not immediately known . he had passed medical and psychological testing when he was hired in 2013 , said carsten spohr , ceo of lufthansa , which owns germanwings . while the ailment lubitz had sought treatment for has n't been revealed , that he was declared unfit for work is an important detail , aviation analysts say . pilots are required to maintain their fitness to fly and must tell their airline if they 're found unfit , cnn aviation analyst david soucie said . reuters reported that a german newspaper said lubitz had been treated for depression about six years ago . citing internal documents forwarded by lufthansa to german authorities , bild reported that lubitz had suffered a " serious depressive episode " around the time he took a break from his pilot training in 2009 , reuters reported . the bild report said he then spent about 18 months getting psychiatric treatment . lufthansa officials and german prosecutors declined to comment on the bild story , reuters said . who was co-pilot andreas lubitz ? although authorities have recovered the cockpit voice recorder , the flight data recorder remains missing . it could shed crucial details about what happened inside the cockpit , authorities say . rescuers have found bodies at the rugged crash site , but few of them are intact , yves naffrechoux , captain of rescue operations at seyne-les-alpes , told cnn . dangerous and windy condition at the remote site , which covers more than a square mile , are hampering efforts to recover bodies and evidence , he said . officials with experience traversing the french alps are helping technicians who do n't have alpine skills , he said . " since they do n't know the mountains , you need to provide them with equipment , you need to hold them with rope , give them crampons so they can work well and as precisely as possible , so that no evidence , no body part could escape their vigilance , " naffrechoux said . workers are now looking into the possibility of building a road to the site , naffrechoux said . recovery teams have made good progress , a french senior paramilitary police official told cnn . gendarmerie lt. col. jean-paul bloy , who is coordinating the helicopter operations for the crash site , said there will be two aircraft deployed over the scene saturday . there were five on friday , bloy said . as that difficult work continued , relatives and friends of the victims traveled on lufthansa flights to an area near the site where their loved ones perished . they held prayers in le vernet , near seyne-les-alpes , a village serving as a staging post for the recovery operation . flowers and pictures sat on the ground , candles flickering in the cold air . germanwings said it was setting up a family assistance center in marseille , france , with family briefings to start saturday . another flight carrying victims ' relatives was due to arrive in marseille from barcelona on friday . " our focus in these darkest hours is to provide psychological assistance to the families and friends of the victims , " said thomas winkelmann , a spokesman for the germanwings executive board . it could be weeks before all the bodies are recovered , identified and released to the families , authorities said . meanwhile , the european aviation safety agency issued a temporary recommendation that cockpits always be staffed by at least two crew members . " while we are still mourning the victims , all our efforts focus on improving the safety and security of passengers and crews , " the agency 's director , patrick ky , said in a statement . lufthansa and other german airlines have already adopted the rule , the airline said . an official with the german aviation association told cnn that it was only a matter of hours , or a day at most , for this rule to be implemented across all big german airlines . a pilot aboard a germanwings flight friday morning spoke out at the beginning of the trip to " reassure passengers that there will be two people present in the cockpit at all times .

hillary clinton , attempting to quiet concerns about the security of her private email system , said tuesday she never discussed classified information over email . and if hackers tried to obtain copies of her communications , they could n't have , clinton said , because she had ` numerous safeguards ' in place to protect her home-brewed server . ` it was on property guarded by the secret service , and there were no security breaches , ' clinton said at a press conference . security experts remain doubtful , however , that clinton 's emails contained only unclassified information and warn that her email or server could have been hacked without her knowledge - possibly exposing sensitive communications between the former secretary of state and the president . if hackers tried to obtain copies of her sensitive , state department communications , they could n't have , hillary clinton told reporters tuesday , because she had ` numerous safeguards ' in place to protect her home-brewed server ` to say it was n't compromised is to say , " i do n't know it was compromised , " ' stewart baker , an assistant secretary at the the department of homeland security during george w. bush 's presidency told politico . ` it would be pretty easy for a nation-state to compromise that account , and pretty easy to hide the fact that they had compromised that account , ' he said . the white house acknowledged on monday that clinton and obama did email each other from time to time . ' i would not describe the number of emails as large , but they did have the occasion to email each other , ' white house spokesman josh earnest told reporters . the national security agency technician who was in charge of the team that built president barack obama 's specialized blackberry , dickie george , said it 's unlikely the president ever said anything to clinton over email that could be seen as damaging if exposed . ` he 's actually very security conscious ... there 's no , absolutely no , chance that he put anything sensitive in those emails , ' george told politico . still , bruce brody , a former chief information security officer at the department of energy who is now oversee secuirty at cubic global defense , cautioned that even the most innocent of conversations between clinton and obama could be dangerous if they fell into the wrong hands . ` there 's more intelligence in casual conversation than you might think , just because he 's the president of the damned united states , ' baker told the publication . a q and a document sent to reporters by clinton 's staff after the former state department official 's tuesday afternoon briefing with the press asserted that ` robust protections were put in place ' by the secretary and updated as needed . yet it did not say what those were , citing concerns that ` people with ill-intentions ' would attempt to break into her security system , which clinton says was set up her husband , bill , a former president , and guards the private communications of both him and his aides . the nine-page document disclosed , however , that third-party experts were consulted . it did not name names . chris soghoian , principal technologist at the american civil liberties union told politico that unless clinton ` was paying a team of people to keep her personal email secure , it 's likely it was less secure , ' however . the state department , he pointed out , has a full-time security team and the national security administration at its disposal . ` it was on property guarded by the secret service , and there were no security breaches , ' clinton said at a press conference south carolina republican rep.trey gowdy , head of the task force that ' s investigating the 2012 benghazi terrorist attack to determine what knowledge the state department possessed - if any - that could have prevented the assault , said tuesday afternoon that clinton should be required to turn over the server for inspection . she also needs to answer lingering , ` serious questions ` about the security of the system she employed , ' he said in a statement , and ` who had access to the server from the time secretary clinton left office until the time -- almost two years later -- the state department asked for these public records back . ' gowdy also wants access to the server to determine if any of the more than 30,000 personal emails clinton says she got rid of because they were not related to her work at the state department can be retrieved . clinton says gave the state department copies of all her work-related emails , yet ` without access to secretary clinton 's personal server , there is no way for the state department to know it has acquired all documents that should be made public , ' gowdy said . the former obama administration official said tuesday the server will remain out of the government 's grasp , however . ` no one wants their personal email made public , and i think most people understand that and respect that privacy , ' she told reporters while explaining her decision to toss emails she did n't think were pertinent to national security . should clinton change her mind and give the government unfettered access to her private property chester wisniewski , senior security adviser at canadian computer company sophos , says its possible that anything she tried to destroy may still be on the server . ` if the emails were on a server in her house and she deleted them , there 's a chance the emails could still be on the server 's hard drive if you forensically examine it , ' he told the new york times . ` to make sure the emails are really destroyed , you would have to physically destroy the hard drive , which many companies and places like the defense department often do . ' reporters flooded the united nation 's headquarters on tuesday to listen to former secretary of state hillary clinton answer questions about her use of a private email system while serving in president barack obama 's cabinet . a q and a document sent to reporters after the briefing asserted that ` robust protections were put in place ' by clinton and updated as needed another concern of government officials is that clinton deliberated classified information via her personal email address , which is against the law . she says she did n't . ` classified information was viewed in hard copy by the secretary while in the office , ' the statement from her office distributed on tuesday said . but a former senior state department official who worked in the diplomatic core of the government before her told the new york times that clinton 's claim is dubious . ' i would assume that more than 50 percent of what the secretary of state dealt with was classified , ' he said . ` was every single email of the secretary of state completely unclassified ? maybe , but it 's hard to imagine . ' even if clinton did confer with her colleagues about classified topics over email , ` there 's zero chance that she 'll be charged with unauthorized retention of classified information , because she decides what 's classified , ' steven aftergood , director of the project on government secrecy at the federation of american scientists , told the times . the secretary of state , he said , has the highest classification authority at the department and the power to dictate what is and is n't restricted .
most people have walked to the next street and even to the next town to enjoy some fast food from the takeaway rather than eat the less exciting options in the fridge at home . now it seems chimpanzees will also go out of their way in order to find their favourite snacks . researchers at lincoln park zoo in chicago have found that chimpanzees are willing to walk longer distances to get their favourite food - grapes - even when they are offered another option closer to hand . chimpanzees at lincoln park zoo in chicago exchanged white pvc pipes ( above ) for either grapes or carrots the findings suggest that our often irrational willingness to fulfill our cravings for fast food may have origins far back in our evolutionary past . dr lydia hopper , a research scientist at the lester fisher centre for the study and conservation of apes at lincoln park zoo , said she hoped to explore whether the convenience of the snack on offer may also impact how far chimpanzees are willing to travel . chimpanzees have special ` words ' that they use for different types of food and can even learn the calls used by strangers from foreign groups . primatologists have found that a group of adult chimpanzees from a safari park in holland adapted the grunts they produced for foods like apples to match those of other chimps they lived with in edinburgh . their findings are the first evidence that chimpanzees can learn calls referring to specific foods or objects . many scientists have assumed that one of the defining features of human language is that objects and events can be named with different words or symbols depending on the culture . the researchers , whose findings are published in the journal of current biology , watched a group of adult chimpanzees from beekse bergen safari park in the netherlands were moved to join a group of chimpanzees in edinburgh zoo . by analysing the acoustic structures of the calls they produced for apples , they found that the two groups of animals had different calls for the fruit before they were put together in 2010 . while the dutch chimps used high pitched grunts the edinburgh chimps used far lower and softer sounds . after a year of integration , the grunt calls for apple were still different , but after three years the calls produced by the dutch chimpanzees had changed to match those produced by those from edinburgh . she said : ` the chimpanzees , to a limit , were willing to travel farther to obtain the more-preferred grapes . ` future studies should test whether chimpanzees would be willing to exert more effort for more-preferred rewards if the type of effort was different - for example , time to process the food or increased competition to negotiate . ' dr hopper and her colleagues , whose research is published in the journal peerj , gave a group of six captive-born chimpanzees at lincoln park zoo rewards in exchange for small lengths of pvc pipe that the apes had to collect from a single location . the chimps could exchange these ` tokens ' at one of two locations - a close by one that gave them a carrot reward or one further away that gave them a grape . in a previous study dr hopper and her team had shown that the chimps preferred grapes to the carrots . over the course of 15 months the researchers changed the locations of the food to see how the chimps would react . they found that over time the chimps would travel further to collect the grapes in preference over the carrots . their behaviour could be seen as surprising in the context of wild chimpanzees where animals will often have to take food where they can find it . dr hopper said : ` it was quite fascinating to see the developments between each of the three phases of the token exchange study . ` in addition to learning about food preferences and proximity , we also observed innovative , problem-solving behavior among the chimpanzees . ' the first chimpanzee to discover the grapes at the far location was a low-status female called chuckie . dr hopper said that it is possible she began foraging in the further location because it was an opportunity to avoid competition from higher-status chimpanzees . the chimpanzees in the study preferred grapes to less exciting carrots , much like this chimp at taronga zoo chimpanzees , like the one above , are our closest living relatives in the animal kingdom and their behaviour can help to shed light on our evolutionary past , such as how the human diet has changed over time she added that the findings could also help zoos improve the way they care for chimps . she said : ` in captivity , primates are provisioned with food by human caretakers and so have reduced choice over the options available to them . ` unlike wild primates that spend a large proportion of their waking hours foraging for food , captive primates are typically fed following a regular schedule . ` this study was not only of academic interest but also created novel foraging enrichment for this group of chimpanzees and encouraged them to explore their environment to find the best possible foods .

' the couple 's unconventional romance began in march 2011 , when george , who appeared on a number of episodes of real housewives before his daughter aviva was fired from the reality series last year , walked into dana 's miami salon for a pedicure . thanks to his healthy tan , the manicurist admits that she thought the infamous playboy - who became renowned among real housewives viewers and castmembers alike for his ` sickening ' , ` inappropriate ' and ` disgusting ' behavior towards women - was as young as 60 years old . and when george asked her for an email address following his appointment , dana insists that she had no idea he was looking to pursue anything other than a business relationship . but two months later , he surprised her by asking her out on a date . ` i wo n't lie , at first it never even crossed my mind to see george as anything other than a successful businessman who could help me grow my business , ' she says . ` but i could n't see the harm in in saying yes . ' the pair shared a romantic candlelit meal and dana began to feel a mutual attraction . ` the more time i spent with george , the more i began to fancy him , ' she recalls . happy couple : the pair married in an intimate ceremony on the beach in malibu , which george 's daughter , former real housewives of new york star aviva drescher , chose not to attend moving on : george 's first wife , aviva 's mother , passed away a number of years ago ` i loved how intelligent , successful and charismatic he was and suddenly the age difference did n't seem to matter so much . ' and while george 's over-the-top sexual antics were the source of much horror among aviva 's real housewives co-stars , it seems to have worked wonders with dana . about a month into their relationship the pair slept together for the first time , and dana revealed that any concerns she had about their severe age gap quickly disappeared after the pair spent their first night together . ` until i met george i had never ever experienced an orgasm , ' she admits . ` but the first time we slept together , all that changed . ` i thought he might have a wrinkly body and need viagra . but george 's physique is unbelievable as he works out every day -- and viagra was the last thing he needed . ` he 'd studied tantric sex in india and i lost count of the number of times we had sex , but we were still at it when the sun came up . ` he was so skilled , he blew my mind . i lost count of how many orgasms i had . ' ironically , while george 's talents in the bedroom proved particularly effective when it came to wooing his wife , his playboy lifestyle seemed to have the opposite effect on the real housewives - and their viewers . indeed , castmember carole radziwill once went as far as to say of the aging lothario and his ` uncomfortable ' behavior : ` the problem is he 's so over the top , it 's uncomfortable to watch . ' i love a good drama - whether a screaming match or a hair pulling - but i 'm with the audience on this one : get george off the tv . playboy : during his appearances on his daughter 's reality show , george formed a reputation with her castmates for his overtly sexual behavior sun-filled fun : george and dana insist that their age gap does not bother them ` it 's sickening to hear an old man sexually degrade women in all kinds of vile ways . ' but despite his less-than-chivalrous behavior during his appearance on real housewives , it did n't take much for george to win dana over - and the couple 's relationship quickly began to go from strength to strength , despite the then-23-year-old not even knowing his real age . despite knowing george was a widower with three daughters and two sons , all older than her , dana admits that she did n't actually ask his real age until six months after the pair began dating . ` by then i was so in love , i did n't care , ' she admits . ` but on his birthday , i said to him , " tell me the truth . " ` he took a big drink of wine and took my car keys from me in case i ran away . then he said : " i 'm 77 . " ` so many things ran through my mind , about the prospect of having children with someone so much older , or the possibility of him dying years before me . ` but i could n't let age stand in the way of true happiness with my soul mate . ' in august 2013 , george proposed during a family dinner at his daughter 's house and the happy couple tied the knot in a romantic ceremony on the beach in malibu a year later . and while george 's daughter aviva , who was often forced to defend her father 's shocking behaviour to her castmates , did not choose to attend the couple 's wedding , dana insists that the 44-year-old gave them ` full blessing ' before they walked down the aisle . ` george 's kids gave us their full blessing , ' she explains . family ties : although aviva ( r ) chose not to attend her father 's wedding to dana , the couple insist that the 44-year-old gave them her blessing motherhood : aviva and her husband reid drescher ( l ) have two children together ( pictured ) ` after losing their mum , they are glad to see him so happy again . it was so romantic and afterwards we flew to hawaii on honeymoon . ' but not everyone has been so thrilled for the couple . dana admits that some friends have accused her of acting like a ` prostitute ' in marrying george , who is reported to be worth about $ 50 million . ` to this day , people point and snigger if they see us holding hands or kissing , ' dana admits . ` it did upset me , but i 've grown a thicker skin and refuse to let some people 's small mindedness ruin our happiness . ` george is not my sugar daddy . i am a successful woman in my own right . ' i did n't need looking after by a rich man before and i do n't now either . i married him for love . anyone who spends five minutes with us will know we 're the real deal . ' dana says that the pair are desperate to start a family as soon as possible - so desperate in fact , that george revealed during an appearance on real housewives that he has had his sperm frozen so that dana can opt to have his children even after he has died . but dana insists that she has put any fears about george dying before he gets to see their unborn child grow up to the back of her mind . ` of course i worry , but life is too short and for all i know , i could die before him , ' she says . ` i think i am the luckiest woman in the world to have found george . in our eyes love is not a number .

older women are dying needlessly from breast cancer because they are not offered screening on the nhs , mps warn . they say it is wrong that women are no longer invited for mammograms once they reach 70 when they are more likely to die than those in their 50s and 60s . the all-party parliamentary group on breast cancer also warns that an age-bias in the nhs is denying thousands of older women life-saving surgery and chemotherapy . they say attempts by ministers to end this culture have been ` limited ' , ` disappointing ' and ` too slow . ' the all-party parliamentary group on breast cancer says it is wrong that women are no longer invited for mammograms once they reach 70 when they are more likely to die than those in their 50s and 60s ( file image ) although the risk of breast cancer slightly declines once a women reaches 70 , she is actually more likely to die from the illness than younger age groups . this is because the illness is often diagnosed in the late stages when it has already spread to the liver , brain or lungs and is difficult to treat . experts say older women are less mindful of the symptoms than younger generations and tend to have a stoical attitude so do n't want to bother their gp the nhs 's screening programme invites women for three-yearly mammograms between the ages of 50 and 70 . older women can still have x-rays for free but they must go to the trouble of finding a clinic and booking an appointment on their own initiative . mps also fear that thousands of older women are being denied life-saving surgery or chemotherapy tory mp steve brine , chairman of the group , said this led women to wrongly assume that once they had passed 70 they were ` in the clear ' . he added : ` there are generational issues . young women are quite comfortable about talking about this whereas the older generation are n't . ` we are concerned at the slow pace of change . whilst some progress has been made , there is still a lot of work to do in ensuring that older people with breast cancer receive the care , treatment and support that is most appropriate to them . ` women should be given treatment on their fitness , not their age . ' there are 8,300 cases of breast cancer in the uk a year in women in their 70s , compared to 12,800 in their 60s and 10,600 in their 50s . ` but more than half of the 12,000 women who die of breast cancer a year are over 70 . dr fran woodard , of macmillan cancer support , said : ` too often older people do n't get treatment when they need it . ` also , older women are more likely to have the perception that they are wasting a doctor 's time , which means they can delay visiting a doctor and are therefore more likely to be diagnosed later . ' scientists have developed a scoring system to predict the risk of developing heart disease or a stroke within ten years . the globorisk calculator , developed to work out risk in any country , can be used for adults aged 40 and over using information about their individual health and from national databases . the us team that developed the system tested it in 11 countries , including england , where the proportion of men found to be at high risk of having a fatal heart attack or stroke within ten years is 12.9 per cent and of women 10 per cent -- on a par with mexico . dr goodarz danaei , of the harvard th chan school of public health in boston , who led the research , said the system could help identify those at risk who are most likely to benefit from lifestyle changes or preventive drugs . the study , using data from 50,000 people , was published in the lancet diabetes & endocrinology journal .

jerusalem ( cnn ) benjamin netanyahu appears poised to keep his job as israel 's prime minister , declaring victory wednesday following a bitter campaign punctuated by his last-minute appeals to right-wing voters . for weeks , netanyahu 's likud party trailed in opinion polls to the zionist union alliance that characterized him as a divisive leader not up to the task of making the lives of ordinary israelis better . those polls turned out to be wrong . instead , the likud party grabbed at least 29 of the 120 seats in the knesset , israel 's parliament , according to unofficial numbers from the israeli election committee , based on 99 % of the vote . its leaders will have the first chance at forming a coalition government . the zionist union came in second , with at least 24 seats . " against all odds , against all odds , we achieved this huge victory for likud , " netanyahu told jubilant supporters not long after the polls closed tuesday . " we achieved the huge victory for our people . and i am proud , i am proud for the people of israel that in the moment of truth , knew to make the right decision and to choose the real material things over immaterial things . " rather than courting voters in the middle , netanyahu pivoted more to the right with appeals concerning israel 's security . two weeks ago , he made a controversial speech to the u.s. congress warning of any deal with iran on its nuclear program . then , a few days ago , he declared there would be no palestinian state so long as he 's prime minister -- reversing an earlier position and putting him at odds again with the obama administration 's support for a two-state solution . on tuesday , he released a video on facebook claiming leftists were bringing " huge amounts " of arabs by bus to vote against likud . arabs make up about 20 % of israel 's population . " the right regime is in danger , " netanyahu said . " we have an urgent wake-up call . bring your friends , bring your family , vote for likud . " those appeals appear " to have energized that right-wing base , " according to cnn 's elise labott . netanyahu still has to form a new government , a process that president reuven rivlin said he hopes will start sunday . if the likud leader does so -- as expected -- it will leave israel not much different than it was before the election , with a conservative netanyahu still the dominant force facing a dug-in opposition . 5 questions about netanyahu 's apparent victory isaac herzog , who led the zionist union , called netanyahu to concede defeat . but he and fellow opposition leader tzipi livni wo n't go away , with herzog insisting that " nothing has changed . " " this is not the time for coalitions and governments , " herzog said , apparently ruling out joining forces with netanyahu as the labor party has done before . " i think what israel is most in need of is an alternative voice that continues to say the truth . " and i 'm telling everyone , ` believe , a change will come . ' " official results will not be released until next week , with the process of building coalitions expected to take much longer . no party has ever won a majority of seats in the knesset , meaning coalition governments are as old as the modern state of israel . the victory goes to the party leader most suited to put together a 61-seat majority . aaron david miller , an ex-adviser to the u.s. government on arab-israeli negotiations now with the wilson center , predicts former israeli communications minister moshe kahlon will be the " kingmaker " in any coalition government deal based on the support his kulanu party got tuesday . how does israel 's parliament work ? there 's no guarantee netanyahu will form such a coalition and stay as prime minister . but he 's got a better chance than anyone , and overnight he vowed to work " quickly and responsibly to form a new government . " " our country 's everyday reality does n't give us the luxury for delay , " netanyahu said . if he does lead the next government , he will soon go down in history as the prime minister with the longest continuous tenure in israel -- thanks to his back-to-back-to-back election wins . many woke up wednesday questioning all those polls suggesting that netanyahu 's latest six-year term could be coming to an end . israeli media outlets released surveys suggesting that either the zionist union would win the vote or , at least , finish in a dead heat with likud . exit polls from israel 's three major broadcasters showed the two parties neck and neck , not the apparent five-seat advantage that likud appears to have secured . pollster avi degani , who predicted a likud win all along , said other pollsters relied too heavily on internet technology and should have done more surveying by phone . " the internet does not represent the state of israel and the people of israel , " degani said , referring to modern statistical methods . " it represents panels , and the panels are biased strongly to the center . " as netanyahu 's win reverberates , one question remains : did he gain extra seats because of an 11th-hour surge , or were the major polls skewed from the beginning ? why were the election polls so wrong ? netanyahu maintained hard-line positions on settlements and negotiations with palestinians , but his opposition appeared more open to talks and more focused on economic , social and other issues within israel . saeb erakat , the palestinian chief negotiator with israel , said , " the results of the israeli elections show the success of a campaign platform based on settlements , racism , apartheid and the denial of fundamental human rights of the palestinian people . " such a result would not have been possible had the international community held israel to account for its systematic violations of international law , " said erakat , who works under palestinian authority president mahmoud abbas . opinion : will netanyahu win seal iran deal ? the post-election view from hamas , the islamist political and militant movement that controls gaza and is considered a terrorist organization by the united states and european union , appeared more resigned . " hamas does n't see any difference between the israeli parties because they all share the denial of our people 's rights and keeps assaulting them ( people ) , " said sami abu zuhri , a hamas spokesman , suggesting that it did n't matter much who prevailed tuesday . " we assure that the palestinian resistance is strong and can impose the facts .

as manchester united turned in their most dominant display of the season against tottenham on sunday , the influence of one man can not be underestimated . michael carrick 's return to louis van gaal 's starting xi proved crucial at old trafford , and could be the turning point for united as they look to finish in the top four this season . he took less than nine minutes to stamp his authority on the game and show the old trafford faithful what they have so missed during his two months out . michael carrick ( second left ) heads manchester united 2-0 up against tottenham on sunday carrick is congratulated on his goal by his united team-mates during the 3-0 win at old with daley blind on the ball at left back and no tottenham players covering a huge gap just in from the left touchline , carrick burst forward to receive the ball before instantly playing a perfectly weighted pass for marouane fellaini to open the scoring for united . ten minutes later carrick had headed his side 2-0 up and sent them on the way to a vital win . but it was the composure and attacking intent that carrick provided on sunday that united have missed so much in recent weeks - something which was not lost on his manager . ` michael carrick is not my second captain for nothing . he is one of the best passers also , not only wide but also forward . we need midfielders who have that passing , ' said van gaal after the game . indeed , with carrick in the side united have picked up 2.2 points per game compared to just 1.6 without him . the club have won 66.7 % of the game the midfielder has played but than number drops to 42.9 % without the england midfielder . daley blind played at left back against tottenham but has spent most of the season in central midfield ander herrera ( left ) has impressed in midfield for united since signing from athletic bilbao in the summer marouane fellaini ( left ) has been played in an advanced midfield role for united this season liverpool ( away ) - march 22 aston villa ( home ) - april 4 man city ( home ) - april 12 chelsea ( away ) - april 18 everton ( away ) - april 26 west brom ( home ) - may 2 crystal palace ( away ) - may 9 arsenal ( home ) - may 16 hull ( away ) - may 24 in truth , nobody should be surprised . carrick has been a mainstay of united 's midfield for years now , anchoring the side from a deep position . whether his midfield partners have been of the necessary quality over the years is debatable , but with the likes of ander herrera and blind - as well as the revitalised fellaini - now available , carrick should not have to carry the burden all by himself . at 33 , however , carrick remains united 's main man . as well as herrera and blind have done in their first seasons in english football , neither have the authority or influence of carrick . with trips to liverpool , chelsea and everton to come too , carrick 's big-game experience will also be key . with nine games to go , united will be hoping carrick stays fit , because with him in the side , they have a much better chance of finishing in the top four .
the saying ` rome was n't built in a day ' could n't be more apt for super slimmer kirste crompton who has recently lost ten stone . it has taken one year , and lots of hard work , but the mother-of-five has transformed her body after running 1,820 miles on a treadmill at home -- the exact distance from scotland to the italian capital . the 42-year-old has also lost seven dress sizes in the process , taking her from a dangerous 21st and dress size 24 to a healthy and happy 11st and size 10 . kirste crompton , 42 , from bootle , liverpool has lost an incredible 10 stone in her own living room at her heaviest , kirste , 5.8 " , was too 'em barrassed ' to work out in public and instead paid # 65 a month to rent a treadmill from the comfort of her home . today , the housewife and mother runs an amazing 35 miles a week , has recently completed her first marathon and is now hoping to compete in a triathlon . she has also raised over # 600 for the april jones trust , after befriending april 's mother , coral , on facebook . speaking at her home in bootle , liverpool she says : ' i ca n't believe how far i 've come . ` less than a year ago i could barely walk , now i 'm running marathons and am as fit as a fiddle . ` what 's more , i 'm an active mum and can actually play with my kids and take them swimming without my huge tummy getting in the way . i 'm a new person . ' in april 2010 , kirste , then 38 , was diagnosed with postnatal depression after giving birth to her youngest daughter , honey , now four . the mother-of-five rented a treadmill for # 65 a month and turned her dining room into a home-gym she recalls : ` up until then i 'd been around 13st and a size 12 to 14 . but following honey 's birth i fell into deep depression and struggled to get out of bed in the morning . ' i turned to food for comfort and would lock myself in my room for hours eating . ' kirste 's devoted husband david crompton , 36 , a former soldier , looked after honey and kirste 's other four children from a previous relationship : stockard , 9 , pacey , 11 , hermione , 13 and darcy , 16 . at her lowest ebb , the mother-of-five was eating family-sized bags of crisps , drinking three bottles of white wine and eating saucepans full of pasta for dinner . ` food was becoming an addiction , ' she continues , ` it was all i thought about . ' within the space of four years , kirste had ballooned from a size 12 to a 24 and was tipping the scales at 21 stone . she says : ' i was morbidly obese and was so ashamed of my wide girth i could n't face looking in the mirror or getting dressed in the mornings . kirste , pictured on her wedding day , says she was once ` an embarrassment to my kids , ' ` more importantly , it was preventing me from being a good mother . i was so overweight i could n't pick honey up or play with my kids because my gigantic tummy was in the way . ' kirste explains that she was caught in a vicious circle : she felt guilty about her size which made her feel depressed and then turned to comfort food to make herself feel better . she says : ' i hated dropping the kids off at school because the other parents would stare at me and exchange looks . ' i was obese and it was an embarrassment for my kids . ' kirste 's wake-up call came in february 2014 , nearly four years after giving birth to honey . she says : ' i was at home preparing dinner when another parent knocked on my front door . ` there had been an altercation between our kids and we were trying to resolve it . but during her rant she called me a ` fat cow ' . ' i went bright red and felt like i was going to burst into tears , it was horrible . ' in that moment , kirste realised it was time to ditch the greasy snacks and calorific booze . too ashamed to be seen outside or exercise in a gym , she rented a # 65 treadmill and turned her dining room into a home-gym . she says : ` it suited me perfectly because no one could watch me working out . ' i downloaded a running training pack from online and started to do interval training . ` walking for five minutes and then running for two . but it was very hard as i was so unfit . tosay the size 10 mother says that eating wholesome food also helped her to tackle her depression in just five months kirste lost an incredible four stone and dropped from a size 24 to a size 16 , gaining the confidence to start running outside ' i tried to use it whenever i could , and when my fitness improved i started running for half an hour a day -- covering 5km each time . ' on top of her new exercise regime , kirste totally changed her diet . she traded family-sized portions of spaghetti bolognese , cheese on toast , crisps and chocolate for fruit , yoghurt and low-calorie meals , and saw the weight start to drop off . on top of this , she stopped drinking white wine altogether , instead drinking water and fresh juice . she says : ` the exercise lifted my mood and i felt like a new person . ' i was no longer suffering from sugar crashes and eating wholesome food evened out my moods and helped with my depression . ' in just five months she lost an incredible four stone , dropping from a size 24 to a size 16 and developing a new hobby in the process . ' i loved running , ' she says , ` i 'd developed a hobby and was becoming a good runner . ' in july 2014 , weighing 17st , kirste ran her first 10km race for bupa in 85 minutes . she said : ` it was a really hot day but i felt incredible afterwards . ' today kirste , now 11st , runs up to 35 miles a week and says that some people barely recognise her in the space of one year , kirste has run 1,820 miles on her home treadmill , the equivalent of the distance from scotland to rome . she said : ` it 's incredible when i look at it like that . ` this weekend i ran the wrexham marathon in six hours and 15 minutes . ` before i would only run in the privacy of my home but now i run outside and feel great . ` people barely recognise me , i 've changed beyond belief . ` more importantly , i 'm healthy and happy and am an active mum to my kids .

the football association has written to aston villa and west bromwich albion over what the governing body calls ` disturbing crowd incidents ' during saturday 's shameful fa cup tie . in a statement the fa says all video footage will be studied to identify culprits and ` ensure they face appropriate punishment ' . tony pulis has called for west brom fans found guilty of ripping up seats at villa park to receive lifetime bans , while similar sanctions are likely to befall home fans who goaded and shoved opposition players . police clash with unruly fans in the aftermath of the fa cup clash between aston villa and west brom the national lead officer for football policing has questioned the scheduling of the match on saturday night villa face the prospect of a significant fine for failing to control their fans over three pitch invasions and the fa will want to establish whether any negligence was the cause . villa have already issued an unreserved apology over the scenes at the end of a game which saw 17 people arrested overall . an fa statement read : ` the fa has contacted both aston villa and west bromwich albion to request their observations in relation to the disturbing crowd incidents which occurred during and after their fa cup quarter-final tie on 7 march 2015 . ` as well as liaising with both clubs , the fa is working closely with west midlands police and notes that a number of arrests have already been made . ` all available video footage will be studied by the relevant parties to identify anyone who has committed a disorder offence inside the stadium and ensure they face the appropriate punishment . ` whilst its investigation continues , the fa will make no further comment . ' aston villa fans celebrated by racing on to the pitch following their 2-0 victory over west brom at villa park police attempt to halt fans who ran on to the pitch after aston villa booked their place in the semi-final a villa statement read : ` aston villa , west bromwich albion and west midlands police are all working together to investigate events which took place both during and after saturday 's fa cup match . ` the club will also cooperate fully with the football association . there will be no further comment until all inquiries are complete . ' the national lead officer for football policing questioned the scheduling of the match , which kicked off at 5.30 pm . ` saturday night football is here to stay , we appreciate that , friday night football is due to be coming in , ' he told bbc radio five live . ` when you have these fixtures you have to be careful about which ones you play . all games have potential ( for crowd trouble ) but clearly some games have more potential than others . ` they are big clubs , not clubs that particularly have a troublesome following but when you have that sort of fixture , late on a weekend in particular , alcohol is a factor . ` if you give people four , five , six hours more drinking time , do n't be surprised if in a highly-charged atmosphere , their behaviour is n't good . villa fans leap over hoardings at full-time , and the decision to play the game at 5.30 pm is being questioned west brom goalkeeper boaz myhill is mocked by an aston villa fan following the home side 's second goal ` if you 're looking at whether alcohol was a factor , there was disorder at a public house near the ground before the game , people being arrested coming into the ground for being drunk and disorderly , being drunk seeking entry to a football ground . ` if you looked at the people who came onto the pitch , a few of them looked like they were worse for wear from some substance and i do n't think there is any coincidence that where there 's alcohol involved , people 's behaviour tends to deteriorate . ' he added : ' i do think there is an issue here for the broadcasters because that game was scheduled for a 5.30 kick-off to meet the bbc 's scheduling . ` broadcasters as well as the football authorities need to start taking these issues seriously . ` what we want is a sensible dialogue so that we schedule the game appropriately . if you look at the four games for the fa cup quarter-finals this week , you could n't probably have picked a worse one to have on a saturday tea-time than a local derby between two big clubs . ' the west brom goalkeeper attempts to make his way safely off the field following the full-time whistle scorer scott sinclair ( second left ) is mobbed by a fan and team-mates ashley westwood and jack grealish villa issued an apology for their fans ' behaviour while west brom vowed to take a ` zero tolerance ' approach after promising to co-operate fully with the fa inquiry . and baggies boss tony pulis has called for a lifetime ban for any of the club 's fans who were found to be responsible for throwing seats . ` if that was the situation , and they 've got cctv cameras up there , those supporters should never come into another football ground . it is like people coming into someone else 's house - you have to show respect . ' west brom forward callum mcmanaman is escorted off the field after a row with an aston villa fan the pitch at villa park can barely be seen s supporters cover practically every blade of grass pulis was also concerned about the ease with which spectators were able to get on to the pitch . he added : ' i am old enough to have seen isolated incidents happen like that . i do n't want to have a go and take anything away from what happened on the pitch and what happened in the game . ` if one thing , villa should look at the stewarding because with a game at this time of night , 5.30 pm , you need to police it properly , and i am sure villa will look at it .

' michelle completed both the 2014 and 2015 new york city half marathons , and now she is training to run a whopping 26.2 miles during the new york city marathon this november . her training plan , which includes spin classes , bootcamp classes and weight lifting , as well as running , has helped her lose 135lbs . and now that she has slimmed down , michelle is slowly but surely gaining her confidence back . new woman : michelle put on 120lbs as a side effect of her polycystic ovary syndrome , a hormonal disorder that causes weight gain ( l ) . after her weight loss surgery , she learned how to control her portions ( r ) not easy : even though michelle struggled to run when she was heavier , she stuck with it ' i used to hate dating and think i 'd have to settle for just anybody , but i do n't feel that way anymore , ' she said . ` the most important change is i accept myself .

a tribunal hearing has found a midwife failed in her duty of care to a teenage mother who she told to ` keep her legs together ' after the young mum suffered a vaginal tear while giving birth . new zealand 's human rights review tribunal also heard community nurse natasha thomson showed up six minutes after the baby was born at her patient 's house on january 15 , 2012 . she did this despite receiving five phone calls in one hour from the mother who described herself to be in ` excruciating pain ' . a new zealand human rights review tribunal found a midwife did not give appropriate care to a teenage mother after she suffered a vaginal tear while giving birth at one point , ms thomson dismissed the increasingly urgent calls from the woman giving birth , her husband and the womon 's mother by saying ` teenage mothers sometimes panic when labour starts , ' the tribunal wrote in its judgement . the patient - only known in tribunal documents as ` ms b ' - gave birth to her baby ` on her hands and knees in the bathroom ' . thomson did not bring her scissors to cut the umbilical cord and instead had to use kitchen scissors found by the teenager 's partner , mr b . after examining ms b 's perineum - the area between vagina and anus - thomson told the mother there was a tear . it was a home birth and the midwife arrived late despite receiving five phone calls in one hour from the mother who described herself to be in ` excruciating pain ' the teenage mother gave birth to her baby ` on her hands and knees in the bathroom ' she said the tear was not a bad one , referring to it as only a ` tiny tear ' . thomson looked at her patient 's perineum again and then advised ms b to be ` ladylike ' , and to keep her legs together and change her pads on a regular basis . but tribunal documents say ms b had to be later admitted to hospital . the midwife also had not told the new parents how to properly care for the wound , which was at risk of infection . tribunal documents said ms b only went to hospital weeks later when the midwife should have had her admitted at the time in the weeks after the pregnancy , ms b was in so much pain in her perineum that she could barely walk . when ms b took a step she could feel the tear pull open , and found it very painful when urinating . she told the defendant that she had tried to make a funnel to prevent the urine from touching the tear , and said that she could not bear the pain . ms b became so desperate she even tied her thighs together with her dressing gown cord so that she would not pull the wound open when she walked . the defendant laughed at ms b 's use of the dressing gown cord , which caused ms b to feel disparaged . the mother was found to have experienced a second degree vaginal tear that she was successfully treated for at wairau hospital the defendant checked the tear and told ms b that the tear was ` healing fine ' . but ms b still told the defendant that she was in a lot of pain . at no stage did the defendant refer ms b to a medical practitioner to assess the perineal tear . ms b was only finally admitted to hospital weeks later on february 10 , 2012 , after she went to her gp about an infection on her finger that had spread to her hand and arm . it was then ms b also asked the doctor to check her perineum . the doctor called an obstetrician to assess her and she was found to have experienced a second degree tear that she was successfully treated for at wairau hospital .
killer pilot andreas lubitz can be heard responding ` hopefully ' and ` we 'll see ' when he ran through in-flight landing checks with the captain of his doomed aircraft . his chilling responses came just a few moments before he encouraged patrick sondenheimer to go the toilet and took control of the flight . later mr sondenheimer is heard shouting ` open the god damn door ! ' as he desperately tried to break back into the cockpit . the exchange was revealed yesterday as pictures of lubitz as a child and a teenager emerged , and it was claimed his girlfriend may be pregnant . new photographs : pictures of killer pilot andreas lubitz as a teenager ( left ) and child ( right ) emerged yesterday , along with a yearbook entry grim task : rescue workers inspect the remains of the germanwings airbus a320 and its victims at the site of the crash , near seyne-les-alpes passengers screamed as mr sondenheimer attempted to smash his way in with a crowbar after lubitz locked him out and put the plane into a descent . but the only sound from the cockpit was lubitz breathing as the aircraft plummeted at 3,500 feet per minute before smashing into the french alps , killing all 150 of those on board . the transcript from the plane 's black box recorder revealed lubitz 's responses to the landing checks and him calmly encouraging mr sondenheimer to go the toilet . after mr sondenheimer left him at the controls , he switched the autopilot from the cruising altitude of 38,000 ft to 96ft -- a move that was certain to crash the plane over the alps . german investigators have found torn-up sicknotes in lubitz 's dusseldorf flat which showed he had hidden the extent of his illness from his employers . at least one of the medical certificates covered the day of the crash last tuesday . the 27-year-old was also said to be ` living on the edge ' because he feared that his deteriorating blurred vision would cost him his pilot 's licence . and his relationship with blonde maths teacher , named by german media as kathrin goldbach , was said to be in trouble , with local reports suggesting she may have been pregnant . maths teacher kathrin goldbach -- who had planned to marry lubitz next year -- reportedly told pupils that she was ` going to be a mum . ' search : the speed of the crash meant that most of it was obliterated and no bodies have been discovered intact debris : a road is now being built to the crash site in the alps near the french town of digne-les-bains in an attempt to help recovery workers she was also said to have travelled to the scene of the crash , only to arrive and discover that he was the perpetrator of the disaster . miss goldbach , 26 , told the pupils at the gesamtschule in krefeld , near dusseldorf , she was pregnant , german newspaper bild reported . the pair met as teenagers while working together at a burger king in his home town of montabaur . they moved together to dusseldorf and shared a flat after he qualified as a pilot around four years ago . they intended to marry but his constant demands and desire to be ` in control ' meant that by the time of the crash she was looking to end their relationship . reports emerged that police searching his flat had found a ` small mountain of pills ' and he had apparently been refusing to take his antidepressant medication . an excerpt from his school yearbook said he would ` become a professional pilot so as to sell his cocktails around the world ' . yesterday a british air safety expert said lubitz was able to hide his medical problems because of a ` gaping hole ' in the system for monitoring pilot health . under confidentiality laws rules , which also operate in the uk , patients do not have to tell gps where they work and doctors are not able to tell employers about any health issues because of patient confidentiality . the onus of reporting any health issues rests solely on employees . remembrance : flags representing different nations are deployed during a ceremony with relatives of victims in le vernet , france , yesterday respectful : a man stands in front of a headstone in seyne-les-alpes , the closest accessible site to where the germanwings plane crashed tony newton , a british pilot and civil aviation authority examiner , said : ` it 's a gaping hole . it would happen in the uk as well . ' on the in-flight recording , described in german newspaper bild , mr sondenheimer is initially heard apologising for a short , 26-minute delay in the departure from barcelona , and promising to make up the time on the routine flight to dusseldorf . during snippets from the conversation , he also explains to his colleague that he had not had time to go to the toilet before they left spain . lubitz tells him he can go to the toilet ` at any time ' in a tone described as ` laconic ' by french authorities . after completing their mid-flight checks for landing , lubitz says to mr sondenheimer again : ` you can go now . ' two minutes later mr sondenheimer agrees to go , and says : ` you can take over . ' there is the sound of a seat being pushed back and a click of the closing door . shortly afterwards there is a loud bang , like someone trying to enter the cockpit . this is followed by a ` loud , metallic banging against the cockpit door ' -- believed to be sondheimer using a crowbar to try to break in . as the jet plunges towards oblivion an automated warning sounds : ` ground ! the pilot is heard shouting : ` open the god damn door ! ' when he realises they are moments from death . as an adult : lubitz can be heard responding ` hopefully ' and ` we 'll see ' when he ran through in-flight landing checks with his aircraft 's captain taking photos : forensic experts from the french gendarmerie disaster victim identification unit working under a tent near the site of the crash at 10.40 am -- eight minutes after the drama began -- the aircraft 's right wing hits the mountain . the final sounds are more screams from passengers as the plane disintegrates and disappears from radar . the speed of the crash meant that most of it was obliterated and no bodies have been discovered intact . a road is now being built to the crash site in the alps near the french town of digne-les-bains in an attempt to help recovery workers and investigators . mr sondenheimer 's grandmother , marianne , told how he had dreamed of becoming a pilot as a boy . she said : ` my grandson is dead and all because of an idiot who did this to his whole flight and killed so many people . ' i just can not understand it . how could he do this ? ' mrs sondenheim , who is in her 70s , said her grandson was determined to become an airline captain , even as a schoolboy . she added : ` he was just 34 years old . ` now this -- i can not bring myself to watch the news any more , it is too much to bear . a young man is dead with so many others .

a film billed as the most dangerous ever made is making a return to the big screen nearly 35 years after its original release . noel marshall 's action-adventure film roar was originally released in 1981 and its 11-year production is infamous for the injuries received by 70 members of the cast and crew . the film revolves around a wildlife preservationist who lives with his wife and children alongside a number of wild lions , tigers , cheetahs and elephants . the film became infamous for the injuries received by 70 members of the cast and crew during production its re-release is due to be shown at a handful of cinemas in the us in april , and will be made available to the wider public on a number of platforms as well . the film features marshall himself , who plays the starring character of hank , while his real-life partner tippi hedren plays the part of his onscreen wife . hedren 's daughter , melanie griffith , is also featured in the film alongside marshall 's three sons and a number of animal trainers . marshall is featured riding on a motorbike at the start of the trailer as one of the lions strikes out at him the idea of the film arrived when marshall and hedren discovered a plantation house overrun by lions while the plot line for the film itself -- two lions putting a family at serious risk by battling for domination -- is action-packed , it is in fact the back story that is the most chilling aspect of the tale . the idea for the film came about when marshall and hedren discovered an abandoned plantation house overrun by a large pride of lions while touring wildlife preserves in africa . hoping to raise awareness for the inhumane treatment experienced by big cats in captivity , they approached a number of animal trainers for help make the concept for the film a reality . marshall and hedren wanted to raise awareness for the inhumane treatment experienced by cats in captivity the couple then began adopting and breeding lions in their home in los angeles and for six years the family of six lived alongside the pack . they eventually moved to a range north of los angeles and began filming . the trailer for the film documents some of the dangers the family put themselves through during production . noel marshall was wounded so many times during the course of the film he was hospitalised with gangrene tippi hedren 's daughter , melanie griffith , needed facial reconstruction surgery because of her injuries marshall is featured on a motorbike at the start of a film trailer , riding through a pack of lions as one of them strikes out at him as he passes by . later he is tackled to the ground by another lion as a humorous review from hitfix appears on the screen : ` it 's like walt disney went insane and shot a snuff version of swiss family robinson ' . genuine fear can be seen etched onto the faces of the various crew members as they are confronted on numerous occasions by the pack . the film 's trailer documents some of the dangers the family put themselves through during production seventy members of cast and crew were injured during the course of the film , but the lions were unharmed the video concludes with the credits and the various injuries sustained by the cast members . hedren suffered a broken leg , griffith needed facial reconstruction surgery and noel marshall was gored so many times he was eventually hospitalised with gangrene . the film 's cinematographer , jan de bont -- who later went on to direct die hard -- required 220 stitches after he was scalped by a lion . the film will be re-released 34 years after it debuted in 1981 and will be shown at a handful of us cinemas no lions were harmed during the making of the film , however . drafthouse films partnered with olive films to re-release the film , which will be available on numerous platforms later in the summer .
scrawled images of mr spock have started appearing on canadian $ 5 bills , with star trek fans defacing the former prime minster in honor of actor leonard nimoy . the act of giving sir wilfrid laurier - who was head of government from 1896 to 1911 - spock 's pointy vulcan ears , sharp eyebrows and signature bowl haircut is apparently nothing new . but following the death of 83-year-old nimoy last week from lung cancer , amateur artists have been out in force , even triggering a reaction from the national bank . tribute : scrawled images of mr spock have started appearing on canadian $ 5 bills , with star trek fans defacing the former prime minster in honor of actor leonard nimoy . long-running tradition : the act of giving sir wilfrid laurier - who was head of government from 1896 to 1911 - spock 's pointy vulcan ears , sharp eyebrows and signature bowl haircut is apparently nothing new a spokeswoman from the central reserve , josianne menard , said tuesday that scribbling on the blue bills is inappropriate because it defaces a symbol and source of national pride . menard warned defaced bills may not circulate for as long and risk being rejected by retailers . ` there are important reasons why it should not be done , ' she noted . however , canada 's central bank confirmed this week that it is not illegal to deface or even mutilate banknotes . following nimoy 's death friday , social media users posted their own versions of sir laurier 's vulcan makeover to honor the actor . but following the death of 83-year-old nimoy ( seen here in a 1982 episode of star trek ) last week from lung cancer , amateur artists have been out in force , even triggering a reaction from the national bank ` spock your $ 5 bills for leonard nimoy , ' a group called the canadian design resource tweeted alongside its depiction . images of the altered bills circulated widely online and attracted international media attention to something many canadians had never seen before - although for others , it was hardly a new frontier . calgary artist tom bagley , who posted his own spock-laurier hybrid on facebook and flickr after nimoy 's death , described it as a traditional bar trick to impress the waitress . ' i always thought it was ok as long as the numbers were intact - it still counted as money , ' he said . ` that 's what i heard . because stuff happens , like say you spill spaghetti sauce all over it or something like that . ' ` spocking fives ' even has its own identity on facebook , where canadians are encouraged to post their revision of sir laurier 's face . a description accompanying the page - founded in 2008 - states : ` the origins of this mysterious tradition are shrouded in secrecy , although it is widely believed to be totally awesome .

frank lampard finally made it to a new york city game on saturday night , but his new club must have wished they had the manchester city midfielder on the pitch rather than in the stands as they lost 1-0 to sporting kansas city . barclays premier league legend lampard is set to link up with his new club on july 1 , but he has been using the international break to check out the city he will call home and to visit the yankee stadium to take in what it will be like playing in major league soccer . but the mls new boys could n't put on a show for their soon-to-arrive designated player and his fiancée christine bleakley on saturday night , crashing to their first defeat of the season against the visitors from kansas . frank lampard is pictured watching on at the yankee stadium ahead of new york city 's game on saturday the mls new boys lost 1-0 to sporting kansas city but lampard enjoyed the atmosphere on his visit lampard has spent the season at manchester city after agreeing his stateside move last summer , but the half-season ` loan ' to the premier league champions caused controversy when it was revealed that the midfielder had instead signed for the entire campaign in england , making him miss the mls ' start . having retired from international football , the 36-year-old had been able to use the break to check out manhattan properties ahead of the game before jetting back to manchester to help out in city 's bid to catch his former club chelsea in the title race it was reported that lampard could have even headed to new york for good this month after finding it difficult to break back into manuel pellegrini 's side , but that now seems unlikely . lampard and his fiancée christine bleakley and pictured arriving in new york earlier this week the manchester city midfielder has been checking out manhattan properties ahead of his july move ` i 'm certain we 'll get to spend some time together , ' new york city fc coach jason kreis said of lampard earlier in the week . ` it 's really exciting , obviously , that he 's going to take that time and make the effort to come over and see us this weekend when he has a break . ` we 'll look forward to spending some time with him and also getting him around the guys some more . i think that 's important . ' lampard has found it difficult to get back into the city team after a good run of games earlier in the season having retired from international football , the 36-year-old took the opportunity to see his new city
the parents of teenagers who flee britain to join isis should take more responsibility for their children 's actions , a senior police officer has said . sir peter fahy , one of the country 's leading counter terrorism officers , said families are more to blame for young jihadis who runaway to syria than the police , schools or local authorities . rather than report their concerns to police for fear of being criticised , some parents are guilty of embracing ` victimhood ' when their children leave , he claimed . sir peter fahy ( above ) said the parents of jihadi runaways should take more responsibility for their actions sir peter 's comments come after the families of three jihadi schoolgirls claimed police had not done enough to prevent their daughters from leaving the country . kadiza sultana , 16 , amira abase and shamima begum , both 15 , fled their north london homes in february . they are thought to have joined former classmate sharmeena begum in the isis stronghold of raqqa . their families have since lambasted police for not warning them that sharmeena had earlier travelled to syria . but sir peter has slammed their ` ill-advised ' condemnation which he says could lead to a ` backlash ' . a senior police officer claimed the families of runaway jihadis were embracing ` victimhood ' . fahmida aziz ( left ) , sahima begum ( centre ) , and abase hussen ( right ) , criticised police in front of a home affairs select committee when three london schoolgirls fled for syria kadiza sultana , 16 , amira abase and shamima begum , both 15 , fled their north london homes in february and were seen on cctv in turkey shortly afterwards ` what is ill-advised is to just blame the police , blame the authorities , blame the school , when the absolute prime responsibility for the welfare of children lies with parents , ' he told the times . ` i 'm not saying that is easy . but it creates the conditions for a backlash which again is not positive . ' his comments come after the the schoolgirls ' families castigated police for not warning them of concerns before the girls fled the country in february . sharmeena begum fled the country months earlier sitting before a home affairs select committee , they claimed they should have been told directly that their daughter 's friend and classmate , sharmeena begum , had gone to syria to pursue terrorists . in a joint statement , they said : ` with respect to the disappearance of our children we have been disappointed by the handling of this matter by the school , met police and the local authority , all of whom we feel failed to act appropriately and pass on vital information to us or indeed between each other . ` as parents , we expect the safeguarding of our children to be the top priority of schools and the local authority whilst our children are in their care . ` had we been made aware of circumstances sooner , we ourselves could have taken measures to stop the girls from leaving the uk . ' while metropolitan police delivered letters to the three girls , its commissioner , sir bernard hogan-howe , admitted their parents should have been contacted directly . sharmeena , 15 , left the home she shared with her father in north london shortly after his second marriage . her mother had not long died . mohammad uddin claimed his daughter was targeted by shadowy extremists on her mobile phone . earlier this week the father of a private schoolgirl from glasgow who fled scotland to become a jihadi bride denied his daughter had recruited sharmeena 's classmates . aqsa mahmood was accused of encouraging shamima begum to join her in syria after communicating with the teenager over twitter . but her father , muzaffar mahmood , said she had no part in the london schoolgirls ' departure to the country , claiming aqsa had been in touch with him to dismiss the accusations . mohammad uddin with pictures of his teenage daughter , sharmeena begum . he said he believes she was targeted by extremists over social media , a concern rife among other muslim mothers he claimed the media was focusing solely on his daughter and blaming her for other teenagers travelling to isis governed regions . ` she texted when this was going on , ' he said . ` she was never in contact with them and i believe her . ' a lot of press - everything happening is aqsa mahmood , ' he said . ` we feel really bad when we hear in the press that she recruited them . ` we regret what she is doing and we condemn what 's going on over there but she has n't been in touch with them [ the runaway girls ] at all . it 's very painful . ' shamima contacted aqsa on twitter , requesting that she follow her so the pair could speak privately via direct messaging . such methods of communication are common among isis recruiters , with many parents fearing their children are at risk of being groomed over social media . organisers of an event in cardiff today claimed some families were ` in denial ' when it came the dangers of websites used by militants to communicate with teenagers in britain . the father of jihadi bride aqsa mahmood ( pictured left and right ) denies she was involved in recruiting three london schoolgirls believed to have travelled to syria to join islamic state muzaffar mahmood said his daughter had contacted the family to insist she did n't know the names of the missing london schoolgirls , and he said he believed her shakila malik , who has two teenage sons , said she was disappointed by the reactions of some mothers who think they are unaffected by extremist . ` personally i do n't think some ( mothers ) are ware , ' the community youth worker said . ` they just think it 's a joke and children are not being groomed . they are in denial . ' the conference was put together by the charity inspire , launched last year in response to the growing threat of extremism . speakers encouraged around 50 muslim mothers to instill confidence in their children and talk to them about radicalisation . worried parents should contact the child 's teachers , imam and even the police , sara khan , who started the charity , said . in the most drastic cases parents could confiscate their child 's passport to stop them from leaving the country , she said . ` it is also important parents understand why is is appealing and to give their children the theological counter narratives , ' added mrs khan .

there may still be 10 games and more than two months to go until the curtain falls on this season 's barclays premier league action . but , somewhat farcically , voting for the players ' player of the year award , has already begun . luis suarez , who scored 31 league goals for liverpool last term before his # 75million summer move to barcelona , currently holds the title . sportsmail 's team of top writers give their verdict on which player they would want to follow in the uruguay international 's footsteps if they were asked to cast their vote today . jose mourinho 's current chelsea team is perhaps the most physically imposing he has ever assembled and matic stands out as a giant among men . a superb reader of the game , matic can pass the ball well , too . he would get in just about every team in europe and that says it all . nemanja matic , in action for chelsea against psg earlier this week , has starred for the blues this season chelsea have been the best team with immense consistency from nemanja matic and eden hazard . but no-one has made a greater individual impact than harry kane . he 's transformed the mood at white hart lane with his energy and desire , deflected attention from the big-money flops and offered hope for the future as a flag-bearer for the youth system . not to mention 26 goals , and an anticipated england call-up . he must finish the season and kick on , but kane seems capable of that . each time he seems about to fade , he hits back . harry kane celebrates with his second successive barclays player of the month award on friday kane , pictured celebrating against queens park rangers , has scored 26 times for tottenham this season who deserves to be voted player of the year today ? here 's my answer to the question : no-one . it 's a nonsense that the players have to vote so soon and shows why the footballer of the year award , voted by members of the football writers ' association , has more credibility . i 'll save my vote until then , thank you . but among the contenders : john terry , harry kane , philippe coutinho , alexis sanchez , diego costa , eden hazard , danny ings , david de gea and charlie austin . voting now is like deciding a wimbledon champion before the quarter-finals are played . i want to see how they fare at the business end of the season . alexis sanchez has impressed for arsenal following his summer switch from barcelona it 's close between hazard and sergio aguero but the brilliant belgian shades it thanks to his remarkable injury-free record . already this season hazard has pulled on a chelsea shirt 41 times and has again been superb . aguero 's susceptibility to various issues stops him from becoming manchester city 's first winner of the award . eden hazard has played 41 matches for chelsea this season but has been one of the league 's best players he deserves it for the surprise element more than anything else - nobody could have predicted his impact at tottenham this season . he lives for the game , thriving on the responsibility of scoring goals for the club and enjoying his relationship with spurs supporters . next week he will be rewarded with a call into the england squad . i reserve the right to change my mind in the next few weeks , as eden hazard and alexis sanchez have both been superb . hazard could become one of the game 's greats . but i 'm close to settling on matic , because his position is often under-acknowledged and because he has provided balance to a chelsea team that had collected flair players while eschewing midfielders who can defend . he is a throwback to patrick vieira : the aggression , the superb distribution , the instinctive reading of the game and , most of all , those longs legs extending to whip the ball away from an attacking player who thinks he is clear on goal . because he is so good defensively , his passing and creativity in forward areas are often overlooked . i 'm expecting the more glamorous players to win the awards but i do n't think any player contributes more to their respective teams than matic . matic parades the capital one cup trophy with branislav ivanovic after their triumph over tottenham sanchez and hazard have both been impressive performers for their sides this season there is nothing dark about the art of kane and a victory for the spurs striker would be a victory for football and all of the reasons why we should love the game . there are no elbows , no spitting , no intimidating referees - he scores goals for his boyhood club and does so with a smile on his face . his brilliant enthusiasm aside , kane is a worthy winner on footballing merit alone and has consistently been the division 's best striker this season . his goals have invariably been match-winning and his breakthrough campaign should be crowned with a clean sweep of the annual awards . david de gea has spared manchester united 's blushes on a number of occasions this season branislav ivanovic would win joe bernstein 's vote he almost certainly wo n't win it but david de gea deserves some representation for player of the year based purely on the fact he has single-handedly and often stunningly rescued manchester united and kept them in the hunt for a top-four finish . this is one of the toughest to call because the obvious stand-out performers - diego costa , eden hazard and sergio aguero - have missed games or been inconsistent . so in a very even field i 'd vote for branislav ivanovic because he 's typified best why chelsea will be champions chelsea are n't winning too many friends at the moment but it does look like they will win a premier league and capital one cup double , and no-one will have contributed more than last season 's pfa young player of the year . a supremely gifted footballer , hazard deserves the main award this season ahead of sanchez , costa , coutinho and kane . nobody goes to football matches hoping for clean sheets but the united goalkeeper has produced saves of wonder this season , genuinely entertaining and worthy of repeated replays as much as any goal . this award should go to a player who has impacted his team significantly , clearly lifting them higher . so far , de gea has done that .

( cnn ) superheroes have always had a special place in my heart . i grew up in zambia in the 1980s , an era that marked the beginning of the country 's worst economic crisis . my childhood memories are of a prolonged state of emergency that was characterized by acute food shortages and an economic decline where the basic needs of the average zambian family were barely met . my siblings and i -- and our gang of friends from around the farmlands -- spent countless hours sitting on a deserted piggery wall , perfecting our extra-terrestrial code language . our goal was to send an sos out to the superheroes in the galaxies , and had our code language been refined enough to reach across the chasm of space , perhaps a spaceship would come down to earth to save us from our dreary lives and carry us away into outer space . rewind to just a few years earlier -- in the mid to late 1970s and before the economic decline -- when superheroes like superman , spiderman , batman and the incredible hulk were huge deals for anyone growing up . in our childhood eyes , these were powerful , all-embodying beings , and their brands were merchandised on t-shirts , caps , lunchboxes , toys , and just about everything . they influenced many aspects of the childhood experience to such an extent that i spent a lot of my formative years aspiring to become a superhero when i grew up . but then disillusionment set in . it dawned on me that i would never be a superhero seeing as most of them were male -- and all of them white . the frantic search for an alternative and relatable superhero that followed only resulted in more disillusionment . so many years later , in the year 2015 , it is somewhat bewildering to experience today the same disillusionment when i see so little representation of cultural minorities in popular media . this is a big deal to me . i am of that school of thought that believes that radio , television , film and other media of popular culture provide the symbols , myths and resources through which we constitute a common culture . the danger of excluding cultural minorities from popular media is that this limited view starts to paint a constrained picture of what a person should look like , how they should behave and live to the negation of alternative experiences of being human . these deliberations are the basis for my graphic novel , " the revolutionist . " a work in progress , " the revolutionist " is set in the near future , on a satellite colony that is located a little off the orbit of mainland earth , and administrated by a corporation . social conformity in the interest of the collective is subliminally reinforced through symbolism and iconology , while the economy is purely corporate-driven . exploitation of human by human , and robot by human gives rise to the resistance . ananiya was only 13 years old when she joined the resistance . now at 17 , she has recently been appointed as an agent in the covert operations division . in the ensuing standoff where the corporation increasingly maintains control with an ironclad fist it is not long before the resistance galvanizes into a full-blown revolution . as the masses are thrust into a state of emergency , ananiya 's world is characterized by curfews , police raids , censorship and propaganda . with this literary and visual offering , i describe a world that is both like -- and at the same time very much unlike -- our own . as a young , black female , my protagonist , ananiya , is the most unlikely hero for the revolution . it would , indeed , be accurate to read her as the antithesis of the typical hero who more often than not is male , white , straight and privileged . hey , maybe someday the nine-year old version of me can grow up to become a superhero after all . see milumbe haimbe 's work here read this : modern african art in the spotlight read this : why i 'm still sad about child marriage read this : why ebola is not liberia 's ` single ' story the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author .

theresa may has shelved a decision on whether water cannon can be used on the streets of britain until after the election , in a major snub to boris johnson . mrs may has refused to sign off the controversial riot control machines despite pressure from the london mayor , who last year spent # 220,000 buying three cannon for use in public order emergencies . home office sources confirmed last night no ruling on permission would be made this side of the election . that means the machines will lay idle , in a potential embarrassment for the mayor . boris johnson spent # 220,000 last year buying three water cannon to use in public emergencies , such as the london riots , but theresa may has today refused to approve their use ( file image ) soon after buying the three german machines last year , mr johnson said it was ` highly likely ' the home secretary would sign them off , adding : ` my view is we need to get on and equip the police with the water cannon they need , or might need . ' but in the past she has expressed concerns about whether they fit with the british model of policing and is thought to have concerns about their safety . the standoff over the issue cast light on the ongoing rivalry between the two , both of whom are seen as potential tory leadership candidates should david cameron lose the election and step down . mrs may 's home office has been locked in a row with the london mayor over the decision to buy the machines and whether they fit with uk policing last night city hall sources insisted mr johnson had known about the timetable for some time and was ` very relaxed ' about the delay . a spokesman for the mayor 's office for policing and crime defended the decision to purchase the cannon , pointing towards support for them among londoners . he said : ` independent polling shows that the majority of londoners support the police having water cannon at their disposal for use in exceptional circumstances . ` the mayor has made his position clear and awaits the home secretary 's licensing decision . ' but critics of cannon warn that in incidents on the continent they have led to serious injury and even death . in one case in germany a man was blinded and in another a protester was stunned and then killed after being run over . water cannon have been used in northern ireland to quell public order incidents , but never on the uk mainland . calls for their introduction came during the 2011 riots and later student protests in the capital . last summer the prime minister 's spokesman also endorsed their use , saying the prime minister ` supports ' the police 's application for water cannon . mrs may and mr johnson two regularly appear at or near the top of polls on who tories would like as a future leader . she is known to regard the mayor as a ` faintly ridiculous ' figure . at the time the mayor purchased the machines , he was warned it could be a waste of taxpayers ' money . when mr johnson purchased the machines he said it was ` highly likely ' the home secretary would sign off on their use , a political gamble that seems to have backfired mr johnson has previously urged police to get ` medieval ' on rioters , and said officers must never again be left powerless in the face of overwhelming violence like that seen during the riots . but he stressed the chances of the machines being used in the capital , or other mainland cities , remained ` vanishingly rare ' . police argue water cannon would be useful in a static confrontation where there is a need to create space between police lines and violent crowds . they said it could have helped protect firefighters and paramedics after shops were set ablaze as rioting spread to croydon in 2011 .
the complexity of the human brain - with its 86 billion neurons - has puzzled scientists ever since the greek philosopher plato attempted to understand how it worked . now researchers are claiming that our brains may in fact be far simpler than had previously been believed - and it took research on sea slugs to reveal it . neuroscientists based at manchester university and the rosalind franklin university of medicine and science in chicago , have studied the brains of sea slugs as they move . researchers studied the brains of the sea slug aplysia ( pictured above ) , which have around 18,000 neurons their brains , while far smaller than our own , share some of the complex structures of higher organisms while their neurons are large and easy to observe . the researchers found that rather than creating a mass of confusing signals that appear in scans of the human brain , they were able to see neurons acting as groups . the act of remembering may be one of the major reasons why we forget , researchers have said . the groundbreaking research was able to identify identify neural fingerprints of specific memories , distinguishing brain activity patterns produced when viewing a picture of a necklace , say , from a picture of marilyn monroe . the study proved that intentional recall is beyond a simple reawakening of a memory ; and actually leads us to forget other competing experiences that interfere with retrieval . the study from the university of birmingham and the mrc cognition and brain sciences unit in cambridge is the first to isolate the ` adaptive forgetting ' mechanism in the human brain . the brain imaging study found that remembering dynamically alters which aspects of our past remain accessible . they found that these groups were actually laid out like tiles to form a circuit . the scientists say that similar patterns exist in the brains of other organisms , including humans , but are scaled up by millions of times . dr mark humphries , a medical research council fellow at manchester university who was involved in the research , said : ` what happens in the brain during movement is currently only well understood for small , dedicated neural circuits . ` this research introduces new methods for pulling apart neural circuits to expose their inner building blocks . ` our methods could be used to help understand how brain networks change in disease states and how drugs act to restore normal brain function . ' sea slugs have just 18,000 neurons in their entire nervous systems yet have been found to be remarkably similar to other organisms . previous research has shown that they can form memories and signal muscle movements in the same way as higher organisms . until recently scientists have had to study brain activity by looking at the action of individual neurons using electrodes . even sophisticated brain scanning technology like functional magnetic resonance fails to provide a clear picture of how the brain is organised beyond its physical structures . the scientists studied neurons in the ganglion area of the brains of sea slugs , shown in the image above the human brain ( shown in the model above ) is known to have specific structures that perform different roles but how neurons are organised within those has remained a mystery as studying them as they work is difficult in the new research , which is published in the journal neuron , the team of scientists were able to map how the large neurons in the brains of the sea slug aplysia as they moved . led by angela burno from the rosalind franklin university of medicine and science , the researchers were able to do this by using a voltage sensitive dye and detecting the tiny spikes in current that occurred in the slugs ' brains as the nerves that drive their muscles fired . they found there were four classes of neural ensembles that behaved in different ways - oscillatory , bursters , pausers and those where there was no strong activity . until now scientists have had to study electrical signals of individual neurons or the whole brain ( like above ) these tended to be organised into modules or tiles that had related activity and pass signals between them in a loop . the researchers say the sea slugs could provide a useful analogy for when studying human brains . professor william frost , a cell biologist at the rosalind franklin university of medicine and science in chicago , said : ` this is a really exciting time . ` this collaboration has created an approach that cuts the time taken to map neural networks from years to a few hours .

a british man is in a serious condition in hospital after receiving a severe machete wound to the head after he was savagely attacked by a gang of robbers in cambodia . michael hay was working as a cashier in a tourist bungalow on the exotic island of koh rong , 15 miles off the coast of sihanoukville , when the gang burst in at 11.30 pm on thursday , lashing out with machetes and clubs . the 27-year-old was struck in the head by a long bush knife and also received a blow to the face with a club . michael hay was working as a cashier in a tourist bungalow on the exotic island of koh rong , 15 miles off the coast of sihanoukville , when the gang burst in at 11.30 pm on thursday he suffered a fractured cheekbone and an 11cm gash to his head , the cambodia daily reports . the owner of the long beach bungalow , jooni huhani nleml , 40 , from finland , also received a blow to the head . both men were taken to calmette hospital in phnom penh to be treated . ` both victims were attacked with knifes to the head and face and were injured seriously , ' sihanoukville police chief phul phorsday said . ` there were two or three perpetrators and we found knives , batons and rocks at the scene which were used as weapons . ' cambodia south coast kompong song province sihanoukville koh rong island koh toch or koh tui beach provincial police chief seang kosal said mr hay was working as a cashier at the bungalows - part of a large workforce of foreign backpackers who have descended on sihanoukville region looking for odd jobs . but what appeals as a dream working location comes at a price , for the area has become notorious for assaults , robbery and rip-off merchants . interior minister sar khen has already sent a team of high-level police to sihanoukville to investigate a spate of recent violence - including stabbings , brawls , a drive-by shooting and even explosions - in which foreigners have been victims . reports of the attack on mr hay and mr nleml come in the wake of an extraordinary story that has emerged in phnom penh in recent days and which has resulted in intense discussion on the khmer440 ex-patriates ' website . the owner of the long beach bungalow , jooni huhani nleml , 40 , from finland , also received a blow to the head the 27-year-old is in a serious condition at calmette hospital in phnom penh after he was attacked with a machete on thursday when a gang of men stormed the bungalow he was at it revolves around an amazing photo of what are described as ` two destitute britons ' who have lost all their money and one of their passports in a hostel robbery in sihanoukville . martin gates , 24 , and nicholas mclernan , 40 , they told the khmer times in a story that has since been pulled that they lost $ us3000 in cash , a laptop computer , two smartphones , bank cards and all their clothes apart from the ones they were wearing . they told the newspaper that they had managed to make their way to phnom penh to ask the british embassy for help in getting home to the uk , but the embassy had turned them away . writers on the forum have questioned their story , some claiming the photo has been manipulated - which has turned out to be not the case - but asking why it appeared the colours on their t-shirts made it look as though they had taken part in a paint-gun battle . some writers believed the pair 's story , while others said it looked like they were on drugs and were pulling a scam . the debate , which has been running for several days since the photo was first published , includes a recent post that declares that ` anyone defending these moronic meth-heads needs their own head checked .

a ten-year-old girl with a rare but intractable form of epilepsy is leading the crusade to have marijuana extract oil approved for medicinal use in her home state of idaho as a form of treatment for her deadly seizures . alexis carey , from boise , has dravet syndrome , an incurable genetic disease that causes severe and multiple seizures , which often leave parents guessing if the terror of watching their child seize up will pass or turn fatal . after her family learned that oil extracted from marijuana had helped other children with her condition , they wanted to see if it would help her too , but idaho 's stringent marijuana laws do not allow for medicinal use . family support : alexis carey ( left ) , a 10-year-old girl with a rare form of epilepsy , sat with her mother clare carey ( center ) and five-year-old sister alanis carey ( right ) last friday in boise , idaho helping hand : alexis , who has dravet syndrome , worked with her therapist brigette borup last week as her family fights to have idaho lawmakers legalize marijuana extract oil to treat her seizures ` parent to parent , when you 're in a small community and 10 people that you know are all having success , that 's no longer anecdotal , ' clare carey , her mother , said . ` that 's hope . ' the family began lobbying lawmakers to decriminalize the oil almost two years ago . now , they 've got some legislative backers and an upcoming hearing , as idaho joins a larger movement to loosen laws to allow the use of marijuana extract oil . twelve states have legalized the oil while still banning medical marijuana . virginia legalized the oil february 26 . in utah , lawmakers have given initial approval to let those with chronic and debilitating diseases consume edible marijuana products , while still banning smoking . marijuana extract oil first received attention when a colorado family fought and won for access for their daughter who also had dravet syndrome . it is similar to hemp oil , which is legal in idaho and can be bought in grocery stores . with no known cure for dravet syndrome , children are often prescribed a cocktail of medications to counter the seizures . however , the heavy drugs often come with side-effects that can permanently damage a child 's developing liver , kidneys and other organs . proponents of cannabidiol oil , a non-psychotropic extract of marijuana , argue that it reduces the amount and length of seizures in children . over time , mrs carey hopes that the oil would also reduce the number of medications her daughter relies on . ` like any parent , you never give up hope that you can get complete seizure control , ' she said . ` children die from dravet by any one of the seizures . alexis could have a seizure that may not stop , we never really know . ' sisterly bond : alexis can be seen playing with alanis . the 10-year-old girl began having seizures when she was only two months old natural remedy : this closeup image shows a drop of marijuana oil on the end of a needle . proponents of the oil for medicinal use argue that it reduces the amount and length of seizures in children making a change : governor terry mcauliffe ( center ) holds haley smith , 14 , from white stone , virginia on his lap after signing the bills that allow the possession of marijuana oils to help treat patients with epilepsy alexis began having seizures when she was two months old . but even in 2003 , her mom says a lack of awareness of the disease led to many doctors not automatically suspecting it could be a rare , genetic disorder . it was n't until alexis lost all speech and potty control when she was two that doctors determined she had dravet syndrome , mrs carey said . since then , alexis ' parents have put her on a variety of diets and medications to help reduce the seizures , but the disease is tricky to manage . dravet syndrome often causes a variety of different kinds of seizures but medications typically target one particular type . alexis ' seizures usually occur at night , which means one of her parents regularly sleep with her and monitor her sleep patterns . during the day , alexis requires constant supervision . while most 10-year-olds freely run and jump around , alexis walks - albeit sometimes unstably and with help going up and down stairs . mrs carey said working with idaho 's republican-controlled legislature has been easier than anticipated . lawmakers who resisted the idea at first blush have warmed up to the idea , she explained . this year , the bill is endorsed by republicans senator curt mckenzie and representative tom loertscher . both are chairs of the legislature 's state affairs committees , panels that often get tossed controversial legislation and have a high bar for clearance . the measure unanimously passed the senate committee during its introduction hearing , which means it now goes on to a full hearing in front of the committee . yet the bill must survive a statehouse that approved a resolution in 2013 vowing never to legalize marijuana for any purpose .
liverpool playmaker philippe coutinho admits he must add more goals to his game as he strives to become one of the best midfielders in europe . the brazilian star has been in outstanding form this season but has scored just five , albeit often spectacular , goals in all competitions as the club have attempted to qualify for the champions league for the second season in a row . in total , coutinho has scored just 13 goals in 92 games since joining liverpool from inter in january 2013 , and the 22-year-old insists he is determined to improve his record in the coming months . philippe coutinho concedes he must score more goals for liverpool to be considered a great midfielder coutinho has five goals for the anfield club this season , but they have often been spectacular strikes he told liverpool 's official website : ' i think i still have to improve . ' i have not improved yet . i scored a few goals last month but i need to improve . ' i have this ambition , this objective of improving finishing . in the position i play , i need to score goals to help the team and create plays . therefore i must improve my goalscoring skills .

now it 's not often that i can claim to be ahead of a fashion trend . but a few weeks ago i was invited to a photoshoot to give my verdict on a new range of suede clothing -- apparently , the must-have fabric this season , as we experience a seventies revival . as someone who remembers the seventies all too clearly , and who boldly wore some of its more questionable offerings the first time round , i was interested to see how i felt about it now . i did n't know i was about to try out a garment that has since fuelled a major fashion debate and divided britain 's women , who , it seems , all have an opinion on that skirt , as it is now known . jane asher ( pictured ) was recently invited to a photoshoot to give her verdict on a new range of suede clothing , what she did n't realise was that the skirt she is pictured wearing would cause such a sensation for the few who have n't heard , i 'm talking about the marks & spencer a-line suede skirt , which has been labelled : ` the skirt that will save m&s . ' yet when i spotted it a few weeks ago , it was just one of several suede garments hanging on a rail , so i had the chance to judge it in an unbiased and objective way . and ... i did n't much like it . i found the suede stiff and heavy , and the colour and shape channelled the seventies cowgirl look a little too closely for comfort . some fashions are best left unrevisited and this length and shape of suede skirt seemed one of them . soon after that , all hell broke loose as various fashionistas were spotted wearing the skirt . it was photographed on the lithe and youthful hips of people who know a lot more about fashion than me -- first alexa chung , then socialite olivia palermo at new york fashion week , both of whom obviously liked it enough to happily endorse it . vogue heralded it ` pure ali macgraw chic ' in reference to the star of the seventies film love story , and suddenly it was the next big thing . alexa chung ( pictured ) was spotted in the m&s skirt in february this year well , i can be as easily influenced as anyone , and a horrible guilt crept over me that i had n't spotted this as the wonder garment everyone else had . i wondered : should i rush out and grab one from m&s ? well , not much point , as it wo n't be on sale to us ordinary punters until april 10 . so , should i trust my first feeling that it was n't for me ? after a bit of thought , i came full circle back to my original decision : i 'm still not a fan . yesterday , daily mail columnist sarah vine was one of the first to shout ` emperor 's new clothes ! ' when she criticised m&s for its aggressive marketing of the skirt , which , she felt -- correctly in my view -- seemed to use a lot of energy that could have been better focused on producing affordable fashion that does n't follow any trend . ` just because a couple of voguettes have given it their stamp of approval , we loyal m&s customers are meant to flock like good little style sheep to get our hands on one , too , ' she said . ` ca n't m&s see how patronising this is ? ' for this suede skirt did n't work in the seventies and it does n't really work now . when i was young , most suede skirts and jackets were stiff , unyielding garments produced in a gingery tan colour that did n't flatter anyone -- especially those of us with gingery , tan-coloured hair -- and it often felt like wearing thick cardboard . sadly , this reincarnation gave me flashbacks . the unsuppleness and heavy feel of the suede may mean it will last for ages , but you 'll know about it while you 're wearing it : the waistband is far from forgiving and i ca n't imagine it will give much across the hips when you sit down , making it stick out unattractively in front . i 'm not crazy about the mid-calf length , either . unless you have the endless legs of a model , it 's hard to carry off . it would look better with boots , of course , but with spring already here i 'm hoping those can be left in the wardrobe . and i ca n't see how the white stitching on hips and tummy can be flattering . sorry , m&s , i 'm giving it just three out of five : wearable for a few outings , after which it would be confined to the back of my wardrobe , never to be worn again . a costly foray into a brief trend -- something that , at my age , i have mostly learned to avoid . jane ( pictured ) loved this flattering suede dress from h&m , finding the whole outfit comfortable and well fitting , without the stiffness of some other suede garments wraparound suede dress , # 199.99 , hm.com suede block-heeled sandals , # 129 , reiss.com bangle , # 39 , reiss.com button diamond ring , # 210 , monicavinader.com my favourite : it 's an excellent price and a beautiful and flattering berry colour , which suits most skin tones . the suede is wonderfully supple and comfortable and fits well . it certainly does n't have the stiffness that some other suede garments have , and the just-above-the-knee length is elegant and suits the shape of the dress . who would have thought i 'd want to be back in a wrap dress again ? i thought we were over those for some time . the fabric updates this classic look . i love it -- especially the great price . the suede culottes jane is sporting here did not get a good review with the stiff fabric and odd shape granting them a paltry 2/5 tweed top , # 129 , baukjen.com suedette culottes , # 24.99 , hm.com heels , # 225 , russellandbromley.co.uk culottes tend to look stiff and oddly shaped unless they 're made in a fluid fabric . these certainly do n't suit me , and i 'm proving that here beyond any reasonable doubt . they cut off my legs at the least flattering part , the calves , and look more dickensian urchin than fashion-forward fabulous . the faux fabric does feel like the real thing , but i suspect that it might crease . if i wanted some suede trousers i 'd save up for a better design . jane ( pictured ) says this suede top may be worth the # 249 you 'd have to shell out to buy it . she found the item ` extremely chic and wearable ' , saying it would work with tight jeans or a smart skirt suede top , # 249 , baukjen.com j. brand jeans , # 180 , trilogystores.co.uk heels , # 5 , everything5pounds.com jewelled necklace , # 85 , stelladot.co.uk deceptively simple , this little suede top just might be a really good investment as it 's extremely chic and wearable , whether teamed with tight brand jeans or a smart skirt . i love the boxy on-trend cut and the sleeve length makes it suitable for any occasion , as well as being long enough to keep the spring chill off and hide any imperfections . this suede is so thin and soft it feels like silk , and i like the tunic slit at the top . another top scorer was this lilac suede dress . jane ( pictured ) says it fits beautifully , skimming fluidly over the body , with the colour adding to the classy look suede dress , # 429 , baukjen.com blue necklace , # 50 , stelladot.co.uk suede strappy sandals , # 250 , lkbennett.com this fits so beautifully and skims fluidly over the body . yes , it costs a lot , but it really does look expensive and the lilac is stunning and classy . the suede has an almost silky feel . i adored wearing this , but the danger of ruining it with smudges would make me wary of splashing out the serious cash . remember that suede needs a lot more care than leather , tending to show rain spots and stains easily , and the soft top layer can wear off after a lot of use . it may be worth protecting expensive suede garments with a special spray , and they will also need expert cleaning .

' american apparel is notorious for their ads of scantily clad ` amateur models ' of all sizes and the company was known to accept model submissions from ` real women ' around the globe . despite the company 's public attempt to distance themselves from their old image , the american apparel website still says nothing about their desire to use more conventional models . ` we find our models all over the world , through online submissions , word of mouth , and in retail stores , where we 've been known to do an impromptu test shoot or two . our ads have always been indicative of a time and place in american apparel 's identity , which has evolved into a 12,000 employee worldwide collaboration . explore the online ad archives for a closer look at our ads featuring models , factory inner-workings and the global vernacular that inspires us , ' the website states . one rebranding change made obvious on the website last week is the company 's choice to airbrush out some of the models ' exposed nipples and body hair making them look more like plastic mannequins . nip no nip : the model on the left in see through white lingerie once had her nipples and pubic hair in full display more like the model in the back lingerie on the right animal first reported that the changes could be seen on the company 's lingerie page in the ` new ' section and a brunette model in translucent lingerie who once had more showing was edited to be much less exposed . charney 's replacement ceo paula schneider has said she is attempting to make the brand ` relevant to millennials ' without it bordering on ` pornographic . ' ` this is an edgy brand and it 's always going to be an edgy brand , and it 's about social commentary , it 's about gay rights , and it 's about immigration reform . it 's about the things millennials care about , ' schneider told the new york times in january . while many may welcome the company 's attempt to shave away their previous image , some activists think showing nipple is perfectly fine and empowers women in what otherwise may be a mannequin 's world . michelle lytle , co-founder of the nipple printed bikini line tata top thinks that by censoring women and making them look like mannequins or dolls , the company is actually taking power away from women who should not feel ashamed of their bodies . fired : former ceo dov charney was fired after the company accused him of willful misconduct lytle told animal that american apparel has tried to reach out to diverse audiences by coming out with t-shirts that say ` legalize gay ' and ` legalize la ' but have very little to comment on women 's equality . ` to see them taking a strong stance on those issues but not on women 's equality is disappointing , ' said lytle who runs the feminist clothing line with her partner robyn . ` this is a company that is clearly trying to distance themselves from their founder , ' she continued . ` it 's kind of laughable for them to think that removing nipples from their images of their sheer lingerie is the best way to do this considering their questionable ad choices in recent years . this is a step in the wrong direction and is contributing to the sexualisation of a woman 's body at a time where there is a large and growing movement for equality . ' the clothing company has a tab on their website dedicated to political activism and they offer a stance on gay rights and immigration reform . ` as a company , we have certain resources that individual activists do not . we try to use that special ability to support political causes that need help . american apparel regularly uses its billboards , advertisements , press contacts and even printed t-shirts to speak out about important issues . our two biggest issues have been immigration reform and gay rights , ' says their website . the company 's female ceo has yet to comment on women 's sexuality and empowerment and the company 's choice to airbrush out nipples and pubic hair . the models of american apparel may soon have a new look altogether as the company attempts to truncate their old image .

baby girls from well-off districts can expect to enjoy good health for nearly 20 years longer than those in the poorest towns and suburbs , according to an official analysis . it found that a newborn girl in one of the top 10 per cent of wealthy areas will live 71.3 years before her life is limited by chronic illness or disability . but a girl born in one of the bottom 10 per cent of the most deprived areas can expect only 52.4 years of life in good health . lottery : babies born living in the top 10 per cent of wealthy areas can expect to live up to 20 years longer without disability or chronic illness , than those in poorer areas . baby girls in wealthy areas can expect to live healthy lives the longest the difference means the well-off girl is likely to have a healthy life more than a third longer than that of a girl from a poor district . the figures for boys are highly similar , according to the findings charted by the office for national statistics . they provoked protests from poverty pressure groups , which compared health inequality in britain with health levels in third world countries , and complained that the wealth gap is now dragging down the health of the entire british population . world health organisation figures on healthy life expectancy appear to show that men and women in rwanda can expect to live healthily to 55 and 56 respectively . the same figures , from the global health observatory data repository , show men and women in romania will enjoy good health to 63 and 69 , while those in russia can expect to live to 57 and 66 without serious health issues . poor health : baby boys born in the most deprived areas of britain have the worst prospects having just 52.2 years of healthy living the ons findings for the uk say that healthy life expectancy is at its worst in the very poorest areas of the country -- usually those with high levels of worklessness , benefit dependency and alcohol , tobacco and drug consumption -- and that for four fifths of the population the health gap between the best off and the rest is much less marked . the figures were calculated from the ons annual population survey which checks on the lives of 320,000 people a year . for men , it said that boys born in the most deprived suburbs can expect 52.2 years of good health , compared to 70.5 years for those born in the best-off areas . it said that if the figures were adjusted by measures designed to take into account income across the population rather than just in extremely poor or rich districts , the gaps were wider -- 19.5 years for women as opposed to 18.9 , and 19.1 years for men as opposed to 18.3 . the ons figures showed that , above the poorest fifth of areas , newborn girls can all expect almost 60 years of healthy life or more , and boys more than 58 years . alison garnham , chief executive of child poverty action group , said : ` the statistics lay bare what poverty and deprivation does to children here in the uk -- it damages their health and shortens lives . politicians of all parties need to act . ' comparisons with third world countries were made by the equality trust campaign group . its director duncan exley said : ` the uk is one of the most unequal countries in the developed world . this is damaging our health , our social bonds and our economy . ' the ons figures are based on an analysis of nearly 33,000 neighbourhoods across england , but no individual district is named .
james bond may like his martini shaken , not stirred , but the fictional spy has n't had to contend with zero gravity when sipping his favourite tipple . making cocktails in space is a difficult business , but now there 's a specially designed ` glass ' in the pipeline that promises to force liquid to stay put . grooves in the 3d printed vessel will let astronauts enjoy the aroma of a beverage and keep the fluid in place so they can drink in a way they are used to on earth . a californian company has designed a martini glass ( pictured alongside a cup ) intended for zero gravity that has ridges to ensure liquid stays inside it and can be sipped by an astronaut a company called cosmic lifestyle corp ( clc ) in oakland , california came up with the design - which is a work in progress - to solve the problem of drinking in space . nasa once developed ` parabolic sherry ' and astronauts have been known to have a swig of vodka , but drinking from a conventional glass is difficult . this is because liquid becomes sticky and clumps together in blobs in zero gravity . if a glob of water is broken , for example , it splits into many smaller blobs that scatter everywhere and are hard to clean up . to solve this problem , liquid is typically kept in bags with attachment for straws , but while this is practical , it 's not an elegant solution and means astronauts ca n't smell the liquid , which is naturally less pungent and tasteless in zero gravity . the start-up chose to 3d print the cup so the complicated design can be refined quickly -- with each design taking around 15 hours to print . because there is already a printer on the iss , the idea is that glasses could be printed off straight away , without the need to transport the delicate vessels . in the 1979 film , moonraker , james bond , played by roger moore ( a poster is shown ) , has a space adventure but does n't attempt to drink his signature martini in space the first step is drop the glass inside a 102ft-tall lift at portland state university , to produce two seconds of weightlessness , so that the durability of the glass and how different fluids react , can be tested . experts will use a high speed camera to look at what is happening and refine the design . researchers will then conduct live tests with humans on a parabolic aircraft or ` vomit comet ' . one unofficial test has already taken place . the ultimate goal is to 3d print a ` glass ' on the iss . ` the zero gravity cocktail project is a fluid dynamics and lifestyle experience design experiment , ' the company said . ` we are creating an open air drinking container that allows you to enjoy the aroma of the drink , yet keep the fluids under control . ` your mouth completes the connection like a straw and you can suck the drink into your mouth . ' the ` glass , ' which is said to ` combine the beauty of a classic martini glass with the physics of space science ' has grooves that force liquid to flow towards the drinker 's mouth , in one direction . the start-up chose to 3d print the cup so the complicated design can be refined quickly -- with each design taking around 15 hours to print . because there is already a printer on the international space station ( iss ) , the idea is that glasses could be printed off straight away , without the need to transport the delicate vessels . ` the zero gravity cocktail project is a fluid dynamics and lifestyle experience design experiment , ' the company said . it hopes that products including the glass could be used by astronauts as well as future space tourists and colonists in the future researchers at the maseeh college of engineering and computer science at portland state university recently unveiled a zero gravity espresso cup , which has a series of channels to simulate pouring . ` its geometry is the ` smart ' part , which provides the fluids-control system without requiring pumps or centrifugal forces , ' said drew wollman , who developed the system . ` the shape of the container can passively drive fluids to desired locations without moving parts -- exploiting the passive forces of wetting and surface tension . ' researchers at the maseeh college of engineering and computer science at portland state university recently unveiled a zero gravity espresso cup ( pictured ) , which has a series of channels to simulate pouring the new design makes possible the enjoyment of espresso and other drinks in the low-gravity environments of spacecraft . without the pull of gravity , fluids behave very differently than on earth . instead of ` pouring , ' a liquid retains a more globular shape held together by its own surface tension . this phenomenon complicates even the most basic of maneuvers such as drinking a cup of coffee . drinks have typically bee consumed in plastic pouches in space . this image shows a pouch of coffee attached to the iss ' new espresso machine the 3d-printed espresso cup is designed to cheat low-gravity by channeling liquid along a specifically-calculated contour in the vessel to exploit capillary forces that simulate the action of pouring . experiments related to the development of the zero-gravity cups have been officially dubbed the capillary beverage experiment by nasa . related tests to be performed onboard iss this year include simple drinks such as clear juices , to complex drinks such as cocoa and peach mango smoothies . last year one italian astronaut took an isspresso machine with her to perk up the crew . it 's one of several projects planned by the group who envisage its lifestyle products could be used by astronauts as well as future space tourists and colonists . ` we are hoping to inspire the idea of a future when space hotels are in orbit and settlements are on other planets that people can relax and enjoy the experience of a quality drink , no matter what the gravity , ' the company said . it has created a kickstarter campaign to continue developing the cup and raise $ 30,000 ( # 20,000 ) to eventually print it on the iss . ` this campaign will help us test the glass in real weightless environments , which is very difficult to simulate on earth , ' clc said . there have been many attempts to create cups capable of drinking liquids normally in space . here , astronaut greg olsen uses a hose to blast droplets of water into his mouth the ` glass ' can be pre-ordered from the crowd funding website for $ 400 ( # 263 ) and $ 500 ( # 329 ) for a colourful version , and is due to ship in february next year . earlier this year , researchers revealed a 3d printed design that will let astronauts sip coffee from a strangely-shaped cup . it too uses a series of channels to simulate the pouring needed to create the perfect drink . while a martini glass may be useful , arguably champagne and carbonated drinks remain the final frontier in space drinks because bubbles are n't buoyant in zero gravity conditions as they are on earth and so behave in a strange way . they remain randomly distributed throughout a fluid -- even after someone has swallowed them and small bubbles can join up to make large ones , resulting in digestion problems .
levante manager lucas alcaraz has played down any talk of his side causing an upset at the bernabeu on sunday . despite real madrid 's poor run of form , which has seen the fans turn on some of the players and the management , alcaraz knows that on their day they are more than capable of beating his side . speaking to levante 's official website , alcaraz explained it would need an excellent team effort . levante manager lucas alcaraz takes his team to the santiago bernabeu to face real madrid on sunday levante 's kalu uche ( left ) celebrates after scoring against eibar in a 2-1 victory last weekend he said : ` the players have to play as a team , being able to have order when we have the ball and not suffer losses . ` the potential of madrid is always high . ' a 2-1 over eibar lifted levante out of relegation trouble , but the manager does not think it will mean much come sunday . ` clearly we won the last game , but there is a vast difference between the potential of madrid and ours , ' he said . real madrid manager carlo ancelotti ( centre ) takes charge of a training session at valdebebas on saturday gareth bale ( left ) and cristiano ronaldo prepare for sunday 's la liga clash with levante madrid president florentino perez was forced to come out in support of his manager this week , declaring ` ancelotti will continue ' . a patchy run of form has seen them drop to second in the table , but it was arguably the 4-3 defeat to schalke on tuesday night which was the more damaging to the atmosphere around the club . despite the uncertainty , sergio ramos brushed off the concerns , telling marca : ` if there 's one thing that defines our camp it 's joy , in every ` rondo ' [ piggy-in-the-middle passing drill ] and exercise we do . ` first and foremost you have to be happy and have fun , and we have a terrific atmosphere in the dressing room . ' real madrid president florentino perez holds a press conference at the santiago bernabeu on thursday ramos is expected to return to the side after injury , but toni kroos is expected to be rested in preparation for next week 's crucial clash with barcelona . that means midfielders lucas silva and luka modric are likely to be recalled to the side , the latter after making his comeback from a serious thigh injury in the champions league defeat . daniel carvajal could also be welcomed back after returning to training with the rest of the squad , but despite a step-up in his rehab , james rodriguez is not yet ready to return to action .
more than 1,500 airline passengers may have been exposed to rubella , after an air stewardess unknowingly contracted the disease . the unnamed china airlines flight attendant began developing symptoms for the disease - also known as german measles - on march 14 . four days later , doctors confirmed she had german measles and was placed in quarantine , the people 's daily online reported . incubation : the air stewardess on the china airlines flight ( not pictured ) contracted the disease in february but the woman , from northern taiwan , may have infected a number of people during the incubation period - including passengers on the flights . the chinese centre for disease control ( cdc ) is now hoping to follow up with 1,558 people who travelled on china airline 's flights between february 21 and february 28 , according to asia one . it is thought 686 taiwan nationals and 872 international passengers came into contact with the stewardess . but so far , it has only managed to contact 72 of the individuals - and has encouraged anyone who may have travelled on the flights to come forward . six of the flights were international - four between taiwan to japan , and two between taiwan and singapore . the cdc is contacting the appropriate authorities in each country to track down the last of the international passengers . search : but she may have come into contact with as many as 1,558 people before symptoms arrived rash : an example of the rash rubella causes german measles is one of a number of similar viral infections that children commonly pick up at school . these infections , called enteroviruses or adenoviruses , cause fine pink rashes and mild fevers . rubella - sometimes known as german measles - can cause serious damage to a developing baby if caught by a pregnant woman so it is important to keep an infected child away from pregnant women . the condition has an incubation period of two to three weeks , but actually only lasts for three to five days . an infected child will be infectious from a week before symptoms of the illness appear until four days after the patient appears to have recovered . china airlines is the flagship carrier for china , and is based in taiwan . it operates about 1,300 commercial flights every week to destinations around the world

british airways could be facing a compensation payout of up to # 90,000 following a pungent smell that forced one of its flights to return to heathrow airport . the ba flight to dubai returned to london due to a foul odour emanating from an overflowing toilet , and three passengers have since filed claims for compensation due to the travel disruption . they argue they are entitled to hundreds of pounds each after cabin crew were unable to fix the problem and the flight turned around near brussels . a british airways captain told passengers the smell was from ` liquid faecal excrement ' in a toilet passengers were initially told that they would board another flight in three hours , but it turned into a 15-hour delay . three passengers have contacted claim4flights.com to seek up to $ 600 each ( # 450 ) in compensation , the maximum allowed for a delay of more than four hours when travelling over 2,200 miles as stipulated by eu rules . if all 200 passengers on board the flight were to claim , ba could be forced into paying out up to # 90,000 . one claimant is hertsmere councillor abhishek sachdev , who was travelling to dubai with his pregnant wife and two-year-old daughter . at the time he took to twitter to explain how a ` smelly poo in the toilet ' had forced the plane to turn back and land at heathrow . tory councillor abhishek sachdev was travelling with his pregnant wife and their two-year-old daughter hertsmere councillor abhishek sachdev said passengers were told that crew could not fix the problem speaking to mailonline travel mr sachdev , a tory councillor , said : ` we had booked a night flight to allow my two-and-and-half-year-old daughter to sleep . ` initially we were told that the delay would be three hours until another flight . when we landed , the pilot said it would be a 15-hour delay , until 1pm the next day . a smell emanating from the toilet on a ba flight forced the plane to turn back ( file photo ) ` this meant we lost a whole day of our holiday , and that we also had the stress of travelling on a daytime flight with our toddler daughter . ' mr sachdev decided to lodge a claim with claim4flights.com after being unimpressed with how ba officials dealt with the situation . ` at the baggage collection area , we were told by some ba staff to queue for information . after 15 minutes in that queue , we were then told there was no need to do so , and were given a leaflet , ' he added . ` this leaflet simply said ba apologised for the technical fault , even though the pilot was clear that there was no technical fault . ` we then had to wait 25 minutes to get our accommodation and food voucher . about five or six staff were trying to print these for us but could n't because of system problems they said . ` this was now midnight and we had pleaded with them to hurry up but it still took a long time to resolve . then we got to the hotel , and had to wait another 25 minutes to check in . ' a british airways spokesperson told mailonline travel at the time that they were ` sorry for the discomfort ' of the passengers . david williams , director for claim4flights.com told mailonline travel : ` we are exploring the circumstances against the regulation 261/2004 set by the european parliament which dictates when passengers are entitled to claim compensation for delayed or cancelled flights . ` if the circumstances are such that the delay to the flight was within the control of british airways then each passenger on the flight could be entitled up to $ 600 compensation , assuming there were 200 passengers on the flight then this could cost british airways $ 120,000 in compensation .

manchester united have been linked with summer moves for both gareth bale and cristiano ronaldo . but who would you buy if you could only pick one ? gareth bale and cristiano ronaldo have both been linked with a move to manchester united bale is a better long-term investment but if you 're talking about a transfer this summer that would make an immediate impact , then it has to be ronaldo . united have gone from dominating at the top to fighting for fourth . signing ronaldo would bring united instant success and put them back on the map . he understands the club and would appreciate the enormity of the task , but he more than anyone else would breathe new life into the fans . what a statement that would be . ronaldo enjoyed six successful years under sir alex ferguson at old trafford this feels like a trick question . ronaldo and lionel messi are two of the greatest players we have ever had the privilege to watch . ronaldo has done it all before at united - and we would love to see him do it all over again . ronaldo trains ahead of el clasico against barcelona in la liga on sunday night there 's no real debate . no disrespect to bale , but the all-round game of ronaldo , from his range of skill , shooting , free-kicks , finishing , heading is just better . that does n't make bale a bad player - just not as good . in financial terms you could make a case for bale being five years younger but i 'm pretty sure you could rely on four good years out of ronaldo . ronaldo celebrates after scoring in the champions league tie against schalke earlier this month it is purely an age thing . ronaldo is unlikely to be as good in the next three years as he has been in the last three years and as his body language showed last weekend , you would n't want him around if he feared he was in decline . bale 's game is tailor-made for the premier league and if his pace was added to the current united technicians they would be champions bale trains at the valdebebas training ground before heading to barcelona for the crunch clash no doubting ronaldo is the better player but bale has age on his side and is not so unbelievably selfish as a person that he would pout if a team-mate scores . gareth bale , no question . the former spurs man is only going to get better . bale would make a sensational return to the premier league if he joins manchester united

a potentially deadly bacteria has been accidentally released from a high-security research laboratory leading to serious safety fears . the burkholderia pseudomallei bacteria was found in animals at the tulane national primate research center in louisiana , which is just 35 miles north of new orleans . the bacteria , primarily found in south-east asia , can spread to animals and humans through direct contact with contaminated soil and water . a potentially deadly bacteria has been accidentally released from a high-security research laboratory leading to serious safety fears ( stock image ) but despite thorough investigations by multiple authorities the cause of the release and extent of the contamination are still unknown . it is the latest in a series of significant accidents that have taken place across the country . richard ebright , a biosafety expert from rutgers university in new jersey , said the release was worrying . burkholderia pseudomallei can cause a potentially serious disease in people and animals called melioidosis . melioidosis commonly involves the lungs and has a wide range of symptoms including fever , headache , loss of appetite , muscle and joint pain . it is often mistaken as pneumonia or tuberculosis . several countries have studied using the bacteria as a bioweapon because strains can be resistant to multiple antibiotics . if the disease is left untreated it is fatal . the overall mortality rate is 40 per cent but in thailand , where the bacteria is endemic , it is up to 50 per cent . confirmed infections are relatively rare . ` the fact that they ca n't identify how this release occurred is very concerning , ' he told usa today . ` human error is always the first explanation you should consider for a laboratory accident . the easiest way to transfer something from one place where it 's supposed to be , to another where it is n't supposed to be is by a worker moving from one place to the other . ' research was being completed at the center using rodents to try and find a vaccine against the bacteria . but at least four rhesus macaques - monkeys that were kept in a separate part of the 500-acre facility - have been accidentally exposed to it . the first was discovered nearly three months ago in november and two have since died . all four were in the center 's veterinary hospital at the same time , leading to speculation that it could have been where the animals were exposed . at least four rhesus macaques - monkeys that were kept in a separate part of the 500-acre facility - have been exposed to the bacteria ( stock image ) but one us department of agriculture ( usda ) investigator was also hospitalised after blood tests showed she had antibodies indicating a current or prior exposure to the bacteria . authorities are concerned that too few samples have been taken to decide whether livestock and domestic animals are at risk . only 39 soil samples were taken from the grounds - far less than the 100 recommended by previous research completed in thailand . andrew lackner , director of the center , said : ` we 're taking this extraordinarily seriously . it 's very disturbing to us . ` there has never been a public health threat .

there have been all manner of world cup shambles for england since they should have won the 1992 final here in australia . but never one as bad as this . this , surely , is the worst yet , worse than 1996 when sri lanka 's pinch-hitters left them trailing in their wake . worse , even , than 1999 when england were eliminated from their own world cup the day before the official song came out . and it is certainly worse than the last three world cups when we had come to expect england to struggle in the one-day game , particularly in 2007 and last time when the biggest tournament in limited-overs cricket followed the ashes . james taylor ( right ) was dismissed for just one run as bangladesh bowler taskin ahmed ( left ) celebrates during the 2015 cricket world cup tie bangladesh

moeen lays on the ground after being run out by bangladesh wicketkeeper rahim during the world cup match the 15-run defeat here by bangladesh at the adelaide oval , which confirmed england 's abject surrender , is nothing short of an utter humiliation , an embarrassment that , not for the first time in recent years , leaves them as the laughing stock of world cricket . this was the world cup that england were supposed to take seriously and prepare thoroughly for . this was the world cup that the ashes were moved for , leading to a 5-0 thrashing last winter and all manner of painful recriminations . yet so far advanced has the one-day game progressed in the last two years since england reached the champions trophy final that clearing the calendar and playing only one-day cricket so far this winter has been akin to trying to put a sticking plaster on a gaping wound . england have been able to defeat just scotland in this tournament and after being thrashed by australia , new zealand and sri lanka they have now been humbled by a team in bangladesh who are little more than minnows themselves . this tournament was set up to virtually guarantee the progress of the big eight teams to the quarter-finals . it was almost impossible for england to fail to at least get to the last eight where defeat would have been far from a disgrace . instead this is a defeat that deserves to be considered as a total disgrace . it is one that leaves peter moores fighting to salvage his reputation as a credible coach of england and paul downton , the man who appointed him , facing huge questions about the big decisions he has made . when the dust settles and england have gone through the motions of their last group match against afghanistan they must have a searching examination of how they play one-day cricket and how they can possibly catch up with the rest of the world before they host the next world cup in four years time . it is not just moores and downton with much to contemplate . senior players such as ian bell , stuart broad and jimmy anderson have not provided the proper example needed from senior players in a young team and should retire from one-day cricket to allow a new young vibrant team to be built . and the decision to replace alastair cook with eoin morgan as one-day captain on the brink of this tournament has backfired , the new leader falling for his fifth duck in his last nine innings just when his team needed him most . morgan has been given permission to miss england 's first one-day international after this world cup , against an ireland team having a far better tournament than england , so he can play in the indian premier league . that decision frankly stinks and if morgan does not want to lead england into a new one-day era then he should give up the job now and let joe root , who was seriously considered when cook was sacked , lead them from now on . never mind that jos buttler almost rescued england after they had fallen to 163 for six chasing 275 . and never mind that tv umpire simon fry gave an atrocious decision to rule that chris jordan had been run out when surely there was doubt over whether his bat had bounced up once he had made his ground . england 's bell walks from the field after he was dismissed by bangladesh bowler rubel hossain ( second from left ) during their match bell 's 63 could do little to help england as they were chasing 276 to avoid an embarrassing early elimination in adelaide rubel hossain ( left ) looks towards england batsman bell after he is dismissed for 63 during the world cup

england 's embarrassing elimination at the world cup after their defeat by bangladesh 90 - the amount of runs captain eoin morgan scored in five innings at the world cup 12.2 - the overs it took for new zealand to beat england 's total of 123 in their second group game . 111 - australia 's margin of victory in the opening game of the tournament 654 - total of runs scored by australia and sri lanka against england 1 - number of centuries scored by an england batsman against test playing nations 72 - number of runs scored by sri lanka off the bowling of chris woakes 0 - number of wins registered by england over test playing nations in the tournament 0 - the number of centuries scored by a bangladesh batsman in a world cup before playing england on monday . 37.4-1-234-5 - chris woakes 's tournament bowling figures . 49 - the amount of runs steven finn went for in two overs against new zealand . moores went into full graham taylor mode on the sidelines , raging at the fourth official after a truly awful decision , but in truth england did not deserve to get away with this . they were second best to a tigerish bangladesh just as they have been worse than second best throughout this tournament . and it all started off so well too . it looked as though england were going to have an easy night when anderson found the bite and swing that had eluded him in this tournament to take two wickets in his first seven balls . neither imrul kayes nor tamim iqbal , the dangerman at the top of the bangladesh order , could cope as england made a start full of the sort of aggression and purpose that the seriousness of their plight demanded . yet england could not have expected the resistance and then blossoming strokeplay that came from a batsman who had never made a one-day international century before in mahmudullah . the drop-in pitch at the re-built adelaide oval may have been near perfect for batting but the lack of variety in an england attack that has struggled for penetration in this world cup allowed bangladesh to flourish . mahmudullah found a willing ally in the tiny form of mushfiqur rahim , the bangladeshi ` mighty atom ' who first faced england as a 16-year-old schoolboy 10 years ago , and together they preyed on england 's nerves . mahmudullah certainly enjoyed becoming the first bangladeshi to record a hundred in a world cup match and while he and rahim were adding 141 for the fifth wicket a total beyond 300 looked within his side 's reach . that they fell 25 short of that was down to much improved death bowling from england , chris jordan in particular showing how it should be done after being preferred to steven finn in this winner takes all match . it should have been well within england 's reach but their chase was old-fashioned and flawed with bell , involved in a schoolboy run out that saw the demise of moeen ali , leaving them far too much to do after he had taken 82 balls to reach 63 . the dismissals of bell and morgan in four balls from rubel hossain , faster than any england bowler , left england deep in the mire and even though buttler , their main glimmer of hope for a better one-day future , hit 65 off 52 balls they ended up 16 short . the brilliant hossain finished it by bowling both broad and anderson in three balls in the penultimate over , leaving chris woakes stranded on 42 , to spark off wild bangladeshi celebrations . for england it was the end of the world . bangladesh batsman mohammad mahmudullah reacts after scoring his nation 's first-ever century in a world cup match mahmudullah

( cnn ) [ breaking news update , posted 9:04 p.m. et ] the live stream from what is believed to be the wreck of the world war ii battleship musashi in the waters around the philippines began at 9:03 a.m. local time ( 9:03 p.m. et ) friday . an underwater camera showed various sections of the ship , which displaced 69,000 tons when it was built , putting it in the largest class of battleships at that time . [ previous story , posted at 7:47 p.m. et ] it 's a journey beneath the waves and back in time . microsoft co-founder paul allen plans to live-stream an underwater tour of a wreck off the philippine coast that 's believed to be the remains of a long-lost world war ii japanese battleship . allen , a philanthropist , said last week that he and his research team had discovered the wreck of the musashi , which was once one of the two largest warships in the world . they had been searching for the ship for more than eight years . after the discovery last week , the team shared photos and video footage of parts of the vessel . now , they 're planning to take viewers on a real-time tour of the wreck with the unmanned submersible they used to find it at a depth of around 1 kilometer ( 3,280 feet ) . the live-stream is scheduled to start at 9 a.m. friday , philippines time ( 9 p.m. thursday , et ) . it 's expected to show various parts of the warship , including the bow and stern sections and the conning tower . launched in 1940 , the musashi was , at the time , the largest class of warship ever constructed , displacing more than 69,000 tons . it was one of two yamato-class battleships constructed by the imperial japanese navy . the ship sank on october 24 , 1944 , during the battle of the sibuyan sea , part of the battle of leyte gulf in the central philippines . according to u.s. navy documents , torpedo planes from u.s. aircraft carriers scored at least 10 hits on the battleship over the course of four hours . navy dive bombers also hit the ship 16 times , but it was the torpedo hits that doomed the musashi . more than 1,000 of the musashi 's crew were killed during the battle and sinking . over 1,300 survivors were taken aboard by other japanese warships , according to the u.s. navy report . " we are proud to have played a role in finding this key vessel in naval history and are honored to share it with the survivors , the families of those who perished and the world , " allen said in a statement . he has said his long fascination with world war ii history was inspired by his father 's service in the u.s. army . last week , he tweeted images of the wreck , including one that he said showed the bow of the ship -- featuring a distinctive chrysanthemum , the emblem of japan 's royal family -- and a big anchor . another photo showed valves on which the japanese characters for " main valve handle " and " open " are legible . robert kraft , director of subsea operations for allen 's vulcan company , who will provide commentary during the live-stream , spoke more about the process . " we used historical records from four countries , detailed undersea topographical data and advanced technology to identify the wreckage as the musashi , " he said . " that moment of discovery was exhilarating . " kazushige todaka , the director of japan 's kure maritime museum , said last week after viewing the information posted by allen that it appeared that the vessel was the musashi , although pictures of the entire body of the ship were needed to know for sure . todaka said , given the location and the depth at which the wreck was found , he was " 90 % sure " that the ship was the musashi . " i was really surprised because the location of the sunken ship has never been identified since it went down , " he said . " i have heard countless stories in the past that the ship was discovered , but they all turned out not to be true . " todaka said allen 's team had been in contact with the museum about the expedition and the ship 's potential location . cnn 's yoko wakatsuki and brad lendon contributed to this report .
while driverless cars wo n't be cruising down the motorway anytime soon , they could soon find their way into our airports and campuses . ten us cities will roll out automated vehicle pilot projects this year , with the first being unveiled in tampa bay , florida in the spring . meanwhile , trials will launch in another 12 to 20 us locations by the end of next year , which means driverless cars could be on the roads in up to 30 us cities by 2017 . ten us cities will roll out automated vehicle projects this year , with the first being unveiled in tampa bay , florida in the spring . meanwhile , trials will launch in another 12 to 20 us locations by the end of next year . greenwich in the uk will also be trialling the technology ( artist 's impression pictured ) the trials use vehicles developed by france-based veeo systems , according to a report in the new york observer . these vary in size from two-seaters to large buses . ` some will be on the roads where it 's legal , ' corey clothier , a strategist for automated transportation systems who runs the firm told dailymail.com . elsewhere , he said the focus will be on college campuses , theme parks , airports and downtown areas . ` the whole goal is to launch pilots so we can collect data to help with the regulations that will legalise the cars , ' he added . for instance , in the u.s. army 's fort bragg in north carolina , automated pod-like cars will transport wounded troops from their barracks . ` it 's a wounded warrior campus , and we 're going to start pretty small with two essentially big gulf carts to take the soldiers from living quarters to the hospital next door , ' said clothier . pictured are the locations who have publicly agreed to pilot projects under the comet programme . comet 's ultimate goal is to have the project running in 30 states , but said that some are not yet ready to announce plans ` starting with two vehicles our goal is getting up to six to eight . ' the programme , run by comet llc , is also planning a pilot project at the united states military academy at west point , at the stanford slac national accelerator laboratory , as well as two more projects in florida . meanwhile 70-person automated vehicles will operate in greenville , south carolina and seattle , washington . comet 's ultimate goal is to have the pilots running in 30 states , but said that some areas are not yet ready to announce their plans . as well as the us , the uk will also be trialing the vehicles in greenwich as part of the $ 9 million project called gateway , shuttling people to the o2 arena . clothier explained that the technology works in the same way as google 's driverless vehicles . an on-board computer uses data from sensors , including radar , a laser and cameras , to make turns and negotiate its way around pedestrians and other vehicles . corey clothier , who is co-ordinating the trials told dailymail.com that an accident involved a driverless car is inevitable - although he added none have taken place in his pilots . ` systems will fail , people 's judgements will fail , ' he said . ` if someone jumps out from a blind spot from a vehicle , if it ca n't stop , it ca n't stop . ' ` it 's interesting to see people 's reactions ' , said clothier . ` very few are nervous , or noticeably nervous . ` most of them are curious , excited intrigued and many of them are very comfortable -- or they soon get comfortable . ' ` we 've had interesting reactions from non-riders too . we were in the silicon valley and we had hundreds of people step in front of the vehicle to see what would happen . ' we 've never had an accident . ' a recent report by the institution of engineering and technology highlighted research that showed human drivers change their behaviour when using the same roads as autonomous cars . motorists were found to copy the driving style of the computer controlled cars by leaving less space between them and the vehicle in front , but were less able to react quickly . however , many experts say that driverless cars could actually reduce the risk of accidents as computers are able to react a lot faster than humans . software that guide and control the cars will have to be written with a high degree of accuracy and contain fail-safes , while cars will need to be regularly maintained to ensure there are no faults . google has also been teaching its vehicles to drive more safely by giving them instructions on ` defensive driving ' styles . they have also been experimenting with teaching the vehicles ` body language ' to communicate with other drivers what its intentions are . passengers can set their destination on some of the vehicles by typing it into a map or using commands . a combination of radar , lasers gives the car a 360-degree ` view ' , with sensors linked to computer software able to ` see ' and identify people , cars , road signs and markings and traffic lights . ` it 's interesting to see people 's reactions ' , said clothier . ` very few are nervous , or noticeably nervous . ` most of them are curious , excited intrigued and many of them are very comfortable -- or they soon get comfortable . ' ` we 've had interesting reactions from non-riders too . we were in the silicon valley and we had hundreds of people step in front of the vehicle to see what would happen .

( cnn ) through his work in fashion , erik schnakenberg was drawn to the classic americana style that has seen a revival in the past decade . he was turned off by the price tag of american-made clothing : basic crew-neck tees starting at $ 50 , unembellished selvedge denim jeans priced at $ 250 and up , oxford cloth button-downs cut and sewn in los angeles ranging from $ 150 to $ 300 . " it 's that effortless design that most guys look good wearing , but it was n't really happening for anyone except at the higher price point , " schnakenberg said . to help shrink the gap , schnakenberg and his los angeles neighbor , sasha koehn , started a business with a goal of lowering the barrier to " made in usa " fashion . buck mason has been up and running since late 2013 , offering a focused collection of american-made garments . prices range from $ 24 for a t-shirt to $ 155 for its most expensive pair of jeans , about 25 % to 50 % less than comparable brands boasting the " made in usa " label . how do they keep costs down ? by focusing on just a few items and cutting out the middleman so they can sell directly to customers through their website and storefront in venice , california , they say . with the help of the internet and social media , they have been able to build their brand and find an audience without the help of chains or department stores . " it did n't make sense for us to not do it this way , " koehn said . " maybe that 's us being naive or not thinking like a traditional business manager , but i do n't see how we could have got this started any other way . " brands selling directly to customers is nothing new in retail , and it 's still a big gamble for most . traditional middlemen such as department stores , chains and boutiques help legitimize brands and expose them to consumers faster than brands may be able to build their own fan bases . but some small businesses are finding the cost of that exposure too onerous . by selling directly to consumers , brands increase their margins , control inventory based on their own projections and do n't have to worry about returns from retail store customers . they also have complete control over pricing and may be able to offer lower prices to consumers , said jack w. plunkett , ceo of market research company plunkett research . fueled by venture capital investors , there has been strong growth in new direct to consumer brands , and not only in clothing , plunkett said . but very few actually manufacture in the united states because of the high cost of doing business , especially compared with global competitors . for buck mason , manufacturing in the united states is a matter of principle and direct to consumer a means to that end , schnakenberg said . " it 's that idea of looking at our product and taking pride in creating something from scratch . we may not sell 100 million t-shirts , but we can say we 're to create one thing and make it all here and be part of the process , " schnakenberg said . to make direct to consumer work , buck mason and other plucky entrepreneurs are mixing aspects of traditional business models with customized approaches to production and marketing , taking on much of the work typically done by outside parties . they sell through their own websites and stores , retaining absolute control over branding and merchandising . they build audiences through social media , using it as a branding tool and a forum to seek customer feedback on styles and colors , forming relationships in the process . but it takes more populating a web store or instagram feed with aspirational images of attractive people to reduce margins . brands offering specialty products that stand out have a better chance of surviving , depending on the product and its place in the global market , plunkett said . " overall , this is positive for the sustainability of u.s. manufacturing , but there are many cases in which it will be extremely difficult to have competitive prices when manufacturing here , " he said . instead of designing various products in different colors and styles , fledgling brands have found success in getting just a few items right , developing a cult-like following and adding products based on customer feedback . it 's a model that has worked for adele berne and mike kuhle , who launched the e-commerce arm of their new york storefront , epaulet , in 2008 with a button-down shirt for men and women made in the city . from day one , they have sold directly to consumers through their website and store , using social media to build a fan base that enjoys geeking out as much as they do over fabric origins and stitching details . since then , they have expanded to accessories and footwear , and they offer custom suiting and shirts . along the way , they have earned a reputation for offering quality products sourced and made in the united states and europe . they partner with esteemed brands including shoemaker alden and suit maker southwick on products and offer a handful of other brands for sale . through social media , kuhle says , epaulet has cultivated a fan base interested in the stories behind the brand , its creators and its manufacturing partners . their customers see the value in paying more for products made in the u.s. or europe , and they keep coming back . " your product has to be unique , and it has to be something people want , whether it 's filling a void for something people do n't know they want yet , or it 's something you see in market that you could do better , " berne said . buck mason launched with a simple t-shirt , working with a knitter in los angeles to develop a slub cotton before sending it to a mill outside the city . when it sold out , the company started working on a five-pocket selvedge denim jean sourced from north carolina and cut and sewn in los angeles . it 's an a la carte approach to production that takes more time and attention than the full-package manufacturing typically used by larger brands to fill big orders under one roof . the upside is that it keeps shipping costs down and allows buck mason to respond faster to market demands by placing small orders with a quick turnaround . chris sutton started out making one pair of jeans at a time in his cincinnati , ohio , workshop . as demand for noble denim grew , sutton and his wife , abby , scaled up production by partnering with a tennessee factory that , like most remaining textile manufacturers , had seen better days . as the suttons learned more about the factory 's history and the town it once supported , they realized it needed more business to create sustainable employment opportunities . it was " hipster and naive " of them to think they could make a significant impact with small runs of premium jeans , abby sutton said , and they started pondering new products . they tested the waters with a small run of sweatshirts . after selling out within days , the couple decided to launch a kickstarter campaign to raise funds for a new business . sweatshirts sold under the victor label will be made from organic cotton in the same factory as noble denim . unlike noble , which is sold in a few stores , victor will be sold directly to consumers through the company 's website and its brick and mortar store in cincinnati . cutting out the middleman allows noble to control its brand instead of relinquishing control to wholesalers and create " stability " in terms of sales expectations , abby sutton said . " everyone is oddly reliant on each other but not in way that encourages innovation . " it also creates a quicker " feedback loop " through which the suttons can listen and respond to customer feedback . that 's how they heard from people who said they could not afford to support the " made in usa " movement even though they wanted to . through victor , whose products range from $ 25 for a tee to $ 85 for a hooded sweatshirt , the suttons hope to rehab american-made style 's reputation as exclusively high-end and inaccessible , she said . " there are people who value the idea of u.s.-made but have never taken the step , " she said . " if we can make it for the same price as a gap sweatshirt , hopefully people will see it as easy choice . "

kfc fight : richard burbage promised to take her out for a meal if she joined him at a football match a car dealer got into a row with his wife when he promised to take her out for a meal if she went to a football match with him - then drove her to a kentucky fried chicken restaurant . richard burbage , 41 , of whiteley , hampshire , then tried to fight an expert in martial arts who attempted to break up the argument . the father-of-three was convicted of assault and fined # 320 for attacking julian raffle . burbage had been arguing with his wife , lorraine , in kfc after they had been to a football match on a sunday afternoon . the row erupted because burbage told his wife he would take her out for a meal in exchange for coming to the match with him . but when she discovered the meal meant being taken to kfc in hedge end , hampshire , the couple began arguing . dan o'neill , prosecuting , told magistrates that customers at the eatery became disturbed by the row . he added that customer mr raffle then tried to calm the couple down and intervened . mr o'neil said there was then a struggle between mr raffle and burbage - and the car dealer twice tried to punch him . but what he did not realise was that mr raffle is an expert in the martial art of jiu-jitsu and when burbage tried to upper cut mr raffle , he used his self-defence training to dodge the blows . when the wife discovered she was going to kfc ( above ) in hedge end , hampshire , the couple began arguing burbage was then arrested and charged with common assault . after admitting this at southampton magistrates ' court , he was fined # 200 . he also had to pay # 100 costs and a # 20 victim surcharge . a separate allegation of assaulting his wife by beating on november 30 was dismissed after the prosecution offered no evidence . mark rigby , defending burbage , said : ` he and his wife both describe the relationship as feisty , fiery and passionate . ` what he did was wrong because he swings for him and he bites off more than he can chew because mr raffle is trained in jiu-jitsu . ` with hindsight they are very embarrassed by what sparked this . she was thinking she would be rewarded with a meal and was n't pleased to find out that that meal would be at kfc . ` i think the salient lesson has been learned by the defendant and his wife .

the juror who single-handedly saved the life of arizona boyfriend killer jodi arias by voting not to give her the death penalty is speaking out in her own defense . the 33-year-old known anonymously as juror 17 says she 's received death threats and widespread ridicule ever since she remained unmoved by ` brutal ' jury room debates and an attempt to have her booted from the jury . in a multi-part interview with kpnx in which 17 will no doubt explain her obstinance , the mother of three maintained she entered the trial simply to serve her civic duty and denied allegations she was some ` stealth juror ' intent on saving the infamous murderer 's life . speaking out : the juror who single-handedly saved the life of jodi arias this month is speaking out in her own defense after receiving continued threats and ridicule juror 17 also addressed her past encounters with arias prosecutor juan martinez , facts that would not be revealed until after the march 5 deadlock announcement . ` it was n't easy , i did n't ask for it , i did n't want it , ' she said . ` all i did was answer the questions truthfully . i did n't want to be involved . i did n't want this pressure . ' mostly , those questions revolved around what juror 17 knew about the case going in , which , she insists , was very little . she will live : the latest arias trial became the second to end in a jury deadlock . this one means the killer may not be handed the death penalty ' i live in arizona so i had heard about the case and i had seen just when they would come up on the news , ' she told kpnx . ' i would hear people talk about it and it was n't something i really wanted to get sucked in to . ' when she arrived to the courthouse , juror 17 recalls that there were many cases she could have been called to . in now way , she says , could she have manipulated it so she would . however , her detractors point to her previous connection to juan martinez as proof juror 17 wanted to be in the arias trial and wanted martinez to lose . fifteen years ago , juror 17 's then husband was tried and convicted for robbery by martinez and then sent to jail . juror 17 says she only recognized martinez from television . besides , she loathed her ex-husband and had been open about his abuse when question during jury selection . ` my struggles and my frustrations were always directed towards him , ' she told kpnx . ` it 's preposterous to me to hold a grudge or to blame somebody for doing their job . ' nonetheless , the conspiracy theorizing and social media vexation raged on . ` not recognizing juan martinez is like saying you do n't recognize mickey at disney , ' tweeted @kristyannasmom . ' @katiecoolady wrote : ` bad enough my tax dollar $ went to a victim trashing defense , now to see a $ tealth #juror17 entered the trial , enough is enough #jodiarias ' ' #juror17 ... your lies and deception caused so much pain and heartache that can never be taken back !!! ' juror 17 says she was simply fulfilling he civic duty by showing up for jury service in october . however , her critics accuse the 33-year-old of having it out for prosecutor juan martinez ( center ) for his having put her then-husband away for robbery 15 years ago meanwhile , it was revealed march 10 that jurors had questioned the holdout 's objectivity because she had previously watched a lifetime movie about the arias case , and prosecutors were upset at the juror 's social media activity as she went on facebook and liked several local tv stations and nancy grace of the hln network . the juror said her views were being ignored by the 11 jurors who wanted arias to be executed for murdering boyfriend travis alexander nearly seven years ago . ` my opinion is n't being heard , ' the judge quoted the holdout as saying . the holdout 's identity was leaked through a twitter account that also posted sympathetic comments about alexander , while a pro-arias website also published names of 11 people it said were the jurors who voted to sentence arias to death for the 2008 killing . outrage : social media critics have lashed out at juror 17 with claims she was a ` stealth juror ' out to save arias , that she had it in for the prosecutor and with threats to her and her family reaction : tanisha sorenson , sister of travis alexander , sobs as she hears a hung jury verdict in the jodi arias sentencing phase retrial ` juror safety and the protection of jurors ' personal and confidential information are topics the court takes very seriously , ' the maricopa county superior court said in a statement . dwane cates , a criminal defense attorney in phoenix who is n't involved in the arias case , said the leaks wo n't change the outcome of the case , noting that mistrial decisions ca n't be appealed . arias was convicted of murder in alexander 's death at a 2013 trial that became a global sensation with its revelations about her sexual relationship with the victim and that she had slit his throat so deeply that he was nearly decapitated . a new jury was picked to decide her punishment after the first jury deadlocked on that question . lifetime movie : juror 17 admitted to seeing the lifetime film about the case ( above ) in ` bits and pieces ' while being screened for her service . her fellow jurors would later use this to try to get her removed from the jury a mistrial was declared after five days of deliberations , removing the death penalty as a possible punishment for arias . the judge is scheduled to decide on april 13 whether arias will spend the rest of her life in prison or she will be eligible for release after serving 25 years . most of the jurors said last week that they believed the holdout was biased and opposed to giving the death penalty . judge sherry stephens had individually questioned some of the jurors , including the holdout , who said she was n't socializing at lunch with other jurors in an effort to be impartial . stephens said the holdout had disclosed , before being picked as a juror , that she had seen the lifetime movie about the arias case , but never watched it all the way through . the judge said the holdout juror did n't commit misconduct because she clearly disclosed that she had seen the movie . the judge also refused a request by prosecutors to remove the holdout from the jury because she had liked on her facebook page another film that arias found influential . and the case 's chief investigator said the holdout , who had claimed she had recently been keeping away from facebook , had liked several local tv stations and nancy grace of the hln network . tragedy : arias ' 2013 trial became a sensation with its tawdry revelations about her relationship with alexander and that she shot him in the head and slit his throat so deeply that he was nearly decapitated arias stabbed alexander 30 times , nearly decapitated him when she slit his throat and shot him in the forehead alexander 's body was found in the shower of his phoenix home by his friends five days later
( cnn ) the president repeated an unfortunate and ill-fated claim while campaigning hard for obamacare . " if you like your health care plan , you can keep it . " with that false sloganeering , barack obama made sure he thoroughly owned a piece of the scorn spawned every time an insurance company changed or canceled plans after the aca became law . he 's apologized , but history will record the affair as his " read my lips , no new taxes " moment yet , there are worse moves politicians can make . republicans are making one now . republican leaders are stepping up to offer woefully inadequate stand-ins for obamacare . they 're offering these salves because they 're hoping the supreme court issues a death blow to the federal exchanges that are now facilitating health coverage in 37 states and they want to have a possible alternative . there is plenty of potential the case , king v. burwell , will succeed in halting the insurance subsidies that federal exchanges require to function . the republican leadership is smart . they understand some of the anxiety already percolating up now could transform into a true panic . but in trying to contain fear , they 're guaranteeing they 'll own the anger that comes next . a collection of three congressmen , including senate finance committee chair orrin hatch ( r-utah ) , recently acknowledged the dire need for an alternative in the wake of obamacare 's demise and issued a " blueprint " that nods toward some of the key concepts . rather than subsidize the cost of heavily regulated insurance plans , this proposal would free up the market more , including more price variability , and offer tax credits to help defray the cost for people making up to three times the poverty level . in place of medicaid expansion , the republican plan would cap the federal medicaid support , linking it to the consumer price index . the plan effectively kills universal access by offering people a one-time chance to sign up for coverage , and it does n't require that anyone obtain coverage , making the individual insurance market unsustainable yet again as primarily those who already know they 're in ill health will flood the market and premiums will become unaffordable . if anything , the massive outreach campaigns required to push traffic to healthcare.gov demonstrate the difficulty in getting young , healthy people to act in their own best interests . while this outline potentially salvaged some semblance of the broad health care access the aca is achieving , senator hatch showed his hand with a subsequent washington post op-ed he shared with two other senators . insisting that " republicans have a plan to help americans harmed by the administration 's actions , " you might be forgiven if you did n't realize the harm was simply enforcing one 's civic duty to purchase affordable health insurance . instead , hatch and his colleagues hope to soften the blow by offering a transitional period so that marketplace health plans are n't immediately canceled after the supreme court issues its ruling , expected in june . the senators would generously allow states to develop their own plans , something only the intellectual powerhouse of massachusetts managed to accomplish prior to the aca . with most of the affected 37 states having one or more government branches controlled by a party that preferred the status quo prior to the aca , such state-level innovation is n't likely . louisiana governor and distant republican presidential hopeful bobby jindal advocates a starker response : let 's roll out the welcome mat for the apocalypse . he argues that canceling the subsidies in all 50 states would reduce taxes by $ 48 billion , so canceling them in 37 states is a great start . jindal actually thinks the supreme court 's potential decision against the aca presents republicans with an electoral " solution " -- the chance to bask in the glory earned by a massive tax cut . the white house got a bit desperate in the run up to obamacare , that much is clear from the poor vetting they applied to president 's own stock stump speeches . beyond his unclear rhetoric , they pushed the law through both chambers of congress hurriedly and did n't allow it to receive the normal careful editing and revisions in a joint committee . the president leaped to sign the bill , warts and all , as it very well could have flitted away altogether . now one of those warts has turned cancerous . it surprised everyone involved with debating and covering the aca at the time of its passage , including the lawyers behind this suit , to learn the bill erroneously specifies only state-run exchanges can dole out subsidies . yet in their giddiness over the law 's potential demise over its own inconsistencies , the republicans are getting sloppy too . the case is driven by a small nonprofit outfit called the competitive enterprise institute , which while it has tentacles throughout the republican establishment , means that the case itself , at one point , could n't be blamed as the gop 's own strategy . but now that multiple republican leaders have stepped up to offer these farfetched fix-it plans , and several leaders have even supplied the court with amicus briefs in support of the plaintiffs , there 's simply no separating the gop itself from the supreme court 's decision in king v. burwell . republicans are n't promising that you can keep your plan if you like it . they 're promising , that for millions of americans now receiving their health care through the federal marketplace , you wo n't be able to keep any plan at all . over 9 million people would lose health insurance altogether if the plaintiffs win in king v. burwell , and many more will suffer due to the destabilized markets that in many cases will shut down altogether as rates skyrocket and insurers pull out . none of the republican plans can realistically come together to fill the gap anytime soon , so a gulf will emerge between states with the political will to operate their own exchanges and the red and purple states that do n't have such fortitude . we suffered a rocky transition into the aca , no question , but hospital systems , providers and patients are just now getting the lay of the land . we are seeing some great advantages , particularly in fields like mine . in rehabilitation medicine , we 're seeing that serious injuries that once blocked access to insurance are no longer a barrier . the white house is n't making the mistake of owning what comes next . they 're frank : there are no contingency plans . republicans , apparently , want to own the next wave of insurance cancellations , while refusing to make a simple edit to a bill that for once guaranteed health care for the poor , injured and disabled . so be it -- 2016 is in sight .
the village of aird uig on the isle of lewis will be the best spot to view friday 's solar eclipse - and the only b&b in the area still has a room available for the spectacle . the west side of lewis is the best place in the country to view the event , and stornoway astronomical society has already received nearly 500 enquiries from people across britain and europe wanting to visit the islands for the eclipse . eclipse viewing glasses have been selling out fast - and guest houses and b&b s are opening up seasonally early to cope with the tourist demand . visitors to the isle of lewis will be hoping the clouds stay away on friday for the solar eclipse friday 's solar eclipse will be the most spectacular celestial show of its kind 16 years and the best place to witness it is set to be in the isle of lewis the tiny and remote hamlet of aird uig on the isle 's west coast has been named as the best place in the uk to experience the deepest part of the solar eclipse - and shadow fever is starting to grip the area . seacroft is aird uig 's only b&b . proprietor sarah taylor-gerloch had sold both her spare rooms - but one , costing # 75-a-night , was to a couple of dutch eclipse chasers . ` they have had to unfortunately cancel . he wanted to treat his wife to a surprise 50th birthday experience to watch the eclipse but it turned out there was a clash of birthday surprises . so the room is free , ' said mrs taylor-gerloch . aird uig is set to be the best place for viewing friday 's solar eclipse - and there are still rooms to rent the village of aird uig has only one b&b , and one couple 's cancellation has freed up a room for the eclipse the isle of lewis is als famous for the callanish prehistoric stone circle whis is said to be over 5000 years old ` ironically the other people who have booked did not know about the eclipse until i told them . they were coming for an outdoor break so this is a real bonus for them . ` we have a glorious view all the way to the butt of lewis but the eclipse has helped put aird uig on the map . it will all depend on the weather - if people know it will be clear for the eclipse there will be lots of tourists . but it is a long way to come on the off chance . aird uig is a village on the isle of lewis , in the outer hebrides , scotland . aird uig is within the parish of uig . known for its stunning location with a picturesque bay that offers spectacular elevated views of the surrounding seascape . aird uig is mainly a former cold war camp , high above sea level , used by the raf to man a vital communications post . the giant mast has been removed and now residents want a community buyout of the military land - with plans including an astronomical observatory and getting aird uig listed as an official dark skies spot . richard leparoux , who runs the small four star hotel auberge at carnish in uig , said he had booked out half his four rooms to eclipse seekers from england - paying # 135-a-night . ' i think nearer the time there will be a late rush when people know for sure the weather will be good to see the eclipse , ' he said . pupils at uig primary school have made special eclipse viewers to protect their eyes . ian fordham , chairman of outer hebrides tourism , said the isles were a black spot for all the right reasons . ` many of our members have opened up in march especially for the eclipse , ' he said . ` we have inquires coming in from all over the country and we are expecting a frantic late rush once the weather seems ok . cornwall had something like one million visitors when it had the eclipse . we are not expecting anything like that but it should give the season a once-in-a-lifetime early boost . ` people coming from the mainland have to catch a ferry - it is not like cornwall where people just hopped in a car . ` we have the best view in the uk and these eclipse enthusiasts will travel far distances to see it - and we will be ready to welcome them . ' a spokesman for the western isles council added : ` it is just another good reason to come to the islands to enjoy some of the best scenery in the world - or not , in this case . ' aird uig is a vital communications post , but residents want a community buyout of the military land the moon will travel in front of the sun , casting a shadow over the earth and darkening the skies across scotland and across europe in the morning of friday ( 20 march ) . it is a chance in a lifetime for many to see such a dramatic sight . the partial eclipse - when the moon starts touching the sun 's edge - will start around 8.30 am and will last until about 10.45 am . the further north you go the more complete the eclipse will be - hence stornoway in the outer hebrides of scotland is the place to be on this list dr steve bell , head of the hm nautical almanac office said : ` the path of totality lies well to the northwest of the uk making landfall over the faroe islands and svalbard as totality moves towards the north pole . ` the uk will see this eclipse as a deep partial eclipse . ` the place that sees the deepest partial eclipse of the sun in the uk is the west coast of the isle of lewis close to aird uig . ` here 98 per cent of the sun will be obscured at mid-eclipse at around 9:36 am . ` skies will darken for any location where the maximum obscuration exceeds 95 per cent which includes north-western scotland , the hebrides , orkneys and shetland islands . ' stornoway astronomical society are staging a special observing session at the 5,000 year old callanish stones - thought to have been an ancient observatory . society president donny mackay said it had received a deluge of inquiries about the eclipse and were expecting a large number of visitors . ` the isle of lewis is the best location in the uk for viewing the eclipse - marginally better than in shetland and the orkney isles . we are hoping the weather will be in our favour on the day , ' he said . a team from bbc breakfast will be broadcasting live from callanish too . david warrington , resident astronomer at the scottish dark sky observatory added : ` it will suddenly get dark for half an hour or so with an eerie false dawn . ` from the borders upwards you should get this noticeable darkening and the further north you travel the darker it will appear to be as more of the sun will disappear behind the moon . ' birds can be fooled by the sudden darkness and are likely to fly off to find refuge . experts warned people not to look at the sun for too long and use eclipse glasses or a pinhole viewer .
footage showing murderer jodi arias pleading for her life in a secret testimony has been released , in which she says she regrets stabbing her boyfriend to death , and calls her attempts to cover it up ` revolting ' . arias spoke before jurors in phoenix , arizona , last year - but only after demanding that journalists and film crews be barred from the court . she escaped the death penalty after jurors failed to reach a verdict in a sentencing retrial last week - because one member of the jury held out against executing her as punishment for killing travis alexander in 2008 . at one point she said that seeing alexander 's family speak of their grief in court made her ` wish so badly that i could just take that away from them , and that i could reverse what i did . ' scroll down for video , and a full transcript of arias 's testimony ` it was horrific ' : jodi arias watches the jury enter the courtroom for her sentencing phase retrial in phoenix on thursday morning secret testimony : footage of jodi arias speaking before a jury has been released by an arizona court . arias , shown above on different days of the testimony , spoke on condition of media not being allowed to film - but a legal challenge forced the court to hand over records the footage , recorded in october and november of last year , was only released after media organizations challenged the decision to allow the secret testimony , and asked for full records . authorities at the maricopa county superior court have now released video footage of arias , in which she is questioned by defense attorneys . abc news ran portions of the film on friday . the questioning began with arias openly admitting the murder - but saying she did not admit her guilt to anybody until 2010 because she was so shocked at herself . when asked why she did not confess immediately , she said : ` because what i did was so horrific that i could n't have - i could never have imagined myself doing that to another human being . ' alexander , 30 , was found dead in a shower in his phoenix-area home in 2008 . he had been stabbed more than 20 times , his throat was cut almost from ear to ear , and he had been shot in the face . together : the secret testimony included questions about arias ' time with alexander , whom she repeatedly stabbed , then shot she was then asked for her reaction to hearing of the grief of alexander 's family - and said that it made her wish she could undo the killing , which she claims was an act of self-defense . she said : ' i wish so badly that i could just take that away from them , and that i could reverse what i did , and that i could take away what all these people are feeling that i have hurt , including travis . she also admitted lying to a detective , whom she called of her own volition , about the murder . when confronted with footage of interviews she gave , arias branded herself ` revolting ' . she said : ` it was something that i was years from being able to even come around to admitting to myself that i did something that horrible . ' [ lying to police about the murder ] is revolting . i look at that [ footage ] , i just think about how stupid i was . ' i was lost - i think of what just those lies put so many people through , and i just wish i could - there are a lot of things i wish i could do over again , but that is just one of them . ' when asked to recall photographs of alexander 's mutilated body , she said : ' i caused that pain , and those were his last moments ; and it makes me sick and i wish so badly that i could just so that whole day over again ' . ' i caused that pain ' : arias reacted to gruesome pictures of alexander 's body , which had some 30 stab wounds . the above image of the shower where his corpse was found is among the publishable ones most of the rest of the testimony focuses on arias 's childhood and her past relationships , and also the time she first met alexander , at a convention in las vegas . she described having sex with him for the first time , and how he started suggesting that she join the mormon church . the line of questioning was never completed , because arias refused to continue her testimony after the promise of secrecy was removed . the jury , eight men and four women , ultimately failed to reach a verdict after one of the women voted against the death penalty . after the trial , fellow jurors said the holdout juror was biased . many said arias did not genuinely feel remorse , and was trying to manipulate them . the judge in the retrial will decide on april 13 whether arias will spend the rest of her life in prison or if she will be eligible for release after serving 25 years . since going back to prison , she has been punished for breaking jailhouse rules - and will not be able to buy items such as candy , has had 10 visitors banned , and will not be able to make phone calls unless they are to do with her legal case .

' mr boyle , who paid # 550 for a return flight and # 60 for a two-night stay in pattaya , revealed that he decided to upgrade his luggage after only heading out with a tesco bag ` full of boxers and t-shirts ' . the pair of friends from middlesbrough met up with david lamb ( right ) in the robin hood pub in bangkok mr boyle ( left ) had his trainers stolen ; mr blyth ( right ) grabs some much needed rest before the flight home ` when i got there i bought a bag and some trainers from levis , ' he added . however , on checking out of one hotel after their first night 's stay , mr boyle fell on some hard luck . ` we were checking out , and there was a bit of confusion . one guy started to get involved in the conversation , we had no idea who he was . phillip boyle , 33 , ( far left ) and friend jamie blyth , 33 , ( second left ) pictured with friends they met in thailand the pair flew from manchester airport to pattaya , thailand with a stopover in abu dhabi ` the next minute i looked down and my trainers had gone - he must have had his eye on them and that 's why he came over . ' determined not to let the theft ruin his holiday , mr boyle continued the party - matching up shorts with a pair of black shoes . ` we got to bangkok , and decided we had to get a motorbike as the taxi was n't going anywhere and it was really busy , ' he added . ` but there was no way i was getting on one barefoot , so i reached into my bag and pulled out my brogues and off we went . ' blyth and boyle chill out with an old friend over some beers in bangkok , while right , a bleary-eyed blyth makes his way into a taxi the friends relax in the airport lounge on the way back from thailand after their epic two-day trip the pair had arranged through facebook to meet an old friend , david lamb , who was in thailand at the time . the friends used to play football in the uk with mr lamb , who works in australia and was visiting thailand following a wedding . ` it was great to catch up with people we knew , and it was just a brilliant trip , ' added mr boyle . ` it was definitely worth doing for the sheer craic of it . ' it 's been somewhat of a comedown for mr boyle since he returned to the uk on monday , and he has found himself behind with his work . ` going away has meant i 've let some people down in work terms , and that 's never easy , ' he added . ` i 'm finding myself a bit behind now , but i would n't swap our experience for anything . ' his friend , however , might have some more pressing explaining to do , as mr boyle explained . ` jamie 's got a girlfriend , and it was a real battle just to get hold of his passport to head out to thailand . ` but it 's only two days we were out there , not two weeks , so i 'm hoping he should be ok .

( cnn ) " hey dude -- can you turn your music down ? " if anyone says this to you while you 're wearing your earbuds , take note : you are probably endangering your hearing . more than one billion teens and young adults are at risk of losing their hearing , according to who ( that 's the world health organization , not the rock band ) . it 's not just old folks who suffer hearing loss . just by listening to music at what you probably think is a normal level , or hanging out in loud bars , nightclubs and music and sporting events , you can permanently damage your hearing . by analyzing listening habits of 12 - to 35-year-olds in wealthier countries around the world , who found nearly 50 % of those studied listen to unsafe sound levels on personal audio devices and about 40 % are exposed to damaging levels of music and noise at entertainment venues . it does n't take much time to damage your hearing at a sports bar or nightclub . according to the who , " exposure to noise levels of 100 db , which is typical in such venues , is safe for no more than 15 minutes . " once you lose your hearing , it wo n't come back . rapper plan b and coldplay lead singer chris martin know that all too well . they both suffer from tinnitus , hearing loss that causes a permanent and irritating ringing in the ears , because they did n't protect their hearing . now they 've joined forces with a british hearing loss association to warn others . " i suffer from tinnitus , " says plan b on actionhearingloss.org . " when i first developed it , i thought it was trains rushing by my house as i live near a railway line . it was really loud and an extremely high pitched ringing in my ears . i now have to wear special earplugs when i go to bed to help stop my ears from ringing . " " looking after your ears is unfortunately something you do n't think about until there 's a problem , " says martin . " i 've had tinnitus for about 10 years , and since i started protecting my ears , it has n't got any worse ( touch wood ) . but i wish i 'd thought about it earlier . " when it comes to personal listening devices , the level of damage you can cause to your ears is directly correlated to how long you listen and how loud the sound . " unsafe levels of sounds can be , for example , exposure to in excess of 85db for eight hours or 100db for 15 minutes , " says who . eighty-five decibels is n't all that loud . according to the palo alto medical foundation , it 's about the level of city traffic that you 'd heard from inside your car . some 360 million of us have already suffered moderate to severe hearing loss , according to the un health agency worldwide . while that number does include factors out of our control , such as aging , genetics , birth defects , infections and disease , about half of all cases were avoidable . that 's why who has launched the make listening safe initiative . part of the campaign is to encourage manufacturers to create audio safety features on devices and then educate consumers on how to use them . who is also calling on governments to create and enforce recreational noise legislation . " parents , teachers and physicians can educate young people about safe listening , while managers of entertainment venues can respect the safe noise levels set by their respective venues , use sound limiters and offer earplugs and ` chill out ' rooms to patrons , " says who . in the end , it 's up to each of us to protect our own hearing . the good news is that it 's easy to do . when it comes to your personal audio devices , such as your smartphone : -- turn the volume down . do n't go above 60 % . -- wear noise canceling earbuds , or better yet , headphones . -- take " listening breaks " or only listen for just an hour a day -- get an app for that . download a smartphone app to help monitor safe listening levels . and the next time you go to a bar , nightclub , sports event or concert , use ear protection . " now we always use moulded filter plugs , or in-ear monitors , to try and protect our ears , " says martin . and his kids never go to a concert without big , noise-canceling headphones .

alice moffat received a parking ticket after leaving her car in front of her own family 's driveway - despite displaying her visitor 's badge a driver was left furious after she received a parking ticket for pulling up outside her parents ' home . alice moffat was hit with the # 25 fine after she parked her car across the driveway while visiting april and steve moffat at their house in yeovil , somerset . the 23-year-old , from redhill , surrey , had even placed the visitor 's permit in the window just in case and left it overnight . but she was shocked when she returned to the car the next morning to find a traffic warden had slapped a ticket on the red renault because it was parked just centimetres outside a marked bay . ms moffat , whose family have lived in yeovil for 15 years , said : ' i drove back to the family home late , and parked over my parents ' drive as i almost always do when i know they are not needing to go out that night . ` just to be on the safe side , i also put the visitors permit in my car - not that it really needs to be there as i 'm over my parents ' drive . ` my brother saw a parking warden looking at my car . he thought this was unusual so went out to see what was wrong . i was shocked to discover the parking warden was issuing me a ticket . ` my younger brother immediately asked why , he said ` the permit is in , it 's my sisters car so we 're allowed to park over our own drive ' but the parking warden simply replied saying the car was ` outside of a marked bay . ` he meant my wheel was a fraction over the white line of the bay behind , but not obstructing anyone or any car . ' ms moffat , an actuary , said she and her brother had tried to reason with the warden , and had offered the move the car immediately to no avail . ` the warden replied saying he had already printed the ticket so there was no point , ' she added . the 23-year-old had parked in front of the drive in yeovil , somerset ( pictured ) but was given a fine after being told she had not parked in the correct bay ' i nearly always park over my parents drive , i had a permit in my car to be sure it was okay , and if i was a few centimetres forward , it would not have affected anybody or any car . ' i am now left with fine to pay because my car was parked over my own family 's driveway . ' i think this shows very clearly what all the national press are saying , councils in england are simply using parking fines as a ` cash cow ' . ` they were going so by the book and they did n't use any common sense . ' alice added : ' i have spoken to neighbours who said they have had a similar problem with getting parking fines while parked just slightly over the white lines . ` it 's just so frustrating for my family , as they have to pay for their resident and visitor parking permits . the # 25 fine , issued by a somerset county council civil enforcement officer has since been cancelled ` they pay their way , and do n't expect their family to get fined for parking over their own property . ' a penalty charge notice was issued by somerset county council , stating the car was ` not parked correctly within the markings of the bay or space . ' a somerset county council spokesman said the civil enforcement officer was correct to serve a penalty but yesterday confirmed the ticket had been cancelled . he said : ` having reconsidered the comments by the driver we have exercised our discretion and given her the benefit of the doubt and the penalty has been cancelled .

a revitalised marouane fellaini owes his eventful premier league career to a stand-out performance at anfield -- the ground he returns to on sunday carrying the champions league hopes of manchester united on his broad shoulders . fellaini was a 20-year-old with standard liege when his outstanding display against steven gerrard in a 2008 champions league qualifier persuaded everton to buy him 19 days later for a club record # 15million . he became a cult hero at goodison park for the next five years before signing for manchester united in 2013 . now in his second season at old trafford and used mainly as a striker by louis van gaal , he is in the best form of his united career and scored and made an assist in last weekend 's 3-0 victory against tottenham . marouane fellaini fired manchester united into the lead against tottenham with a smart finish the belgian trains ahead of united 's crucial clash with liverpool on sunday , where he is sure to be involved fellaini has grown from a bit-part player last season to become a vital member of louis van gaal 's squad steve round , assistant-manager to david moyes at everton and manchester united and who worked with fellaini at both clubs , recounts how it all began . ` marouane had been on everton 's radar for a while . his ability to play in different positions was attractive because the club did n't have the money to pay big fees on several players , ' explains round . ` david asked me to go and watch him play liverpool at anfield and he was very impressive . a lot of players would have been dominated in midfield by someone like steven gerrard in his own stadium but marouane competed and gave as good as he got . he was n't overawed and you could see he had ability . ` when david asked my opinion , it was positive and the club signed him in what was a big deal for them given their finances at the time . ' former everton assistant steve round watched fellaini play against liverpool for former club standard liege round gave the midfielder a glowing reference to david moyes who sanctioned a # 15m deal to sign him fellaini became one of the most instantly-recognisable figures in the english game with his huge hair making him appear even bigger than his 6ft4ins frame . he became a fearsome threat in the air though opponents often felt he was too aggressive with his elbows and it has to be pointed out the belgian has received 56 yellow cards and two reds since he moved to england . having worked closely with fellaini , round says there is far more to his game than the 27-year-old is given credit for . ` he is technically very good , he may not have the same range of passing as gerrard but he rarely gives the ball away . and his chest control is as good as anyone i 've seen in the game . he can play three positions well ; holding midfield , number 10 or up top , where we used him with tim cahill in the season we reached the fa cup final . i think he is best in a more advanced position where he has more freedom and not as much defensive responsibilities . round ( left ) was assistant to moyes at everton and then manchester united fellaini became a cult hero at goodison park , where he spent five seasons ` marouane can hold the ball up and bring others into play and i can see why wayne rooney enjoyed playing with him , in a similar way that michael owen benefitted from emile heskey 's physical presence for england . ' a protracted transfer from everton to united was finally completed in the summer of 2013 for # 27million after moyes and round had been appointed at old trafford to begin the post-sir alex ferguson era . ' i remember ryan giggs warning us that manchester united can take some getting used to for new signings . he sited the example of patrice evra who turned out to be a great player for the club . ryan said he was taken off after 45 minutes of his debut against manchester city because it was such a culture shock . ` marouane is a humorous guy , always able to take fun out of himself . but i guess being the only signing of that transfer window brought its own pressure and looking back maybe he was a bit quieter at the beginning than he was at everton . but that 's also natural when you are joining a new club with players who have been successful . ' fellaini followed moyes to manchester united , but was considered a figure of fun after the disappointing season under the former everton boss fellaini starred in the 3-0 win over liverpool at old trafford in december , and offers van gaal an alternative after a nightmare first season in which united finisehd seventh , moyes was sacked and round left too . fellaini stayed but was regarded at that time as a figure of fun . round is not surprised he has been able to turn his fortunes around . ' i always thought he would show people what he could do at united . it 's like ryan said , it can take a few months for a new signing to be comfortable . he has always worked hard in training , he does n't hide when things are n't going well . ` it 's hard to say what will happen at united next . the pressure is always on to win matches and you do n't know what the manager will do in the summer . but marouane has shown this season he is an asset to manchester united . ' and at lunchtime on sunday , he will hope to show that at anfield , the ground where it all started for him . the only thing he 'd like to change is the result -- seven years ago , liverpool edged liege 1-0 with an injury-time winner from dirk kuyt .
the 9/11 museum has won a top entertainment award alongside the wizarding world of harry potter during a ceremony in disneyland - angering victim 's families who claim officials have made ground zero a theme park , not a shrine . the themed entertainment association honored the $ 700 million national september 11 memorial & museum with an award for ` extraordinary cultural achievement ' , leaving relatives complaining it was more concerned with profit than the memory of their loved ones . the black-tie award ceremony was held in the grand ballroom at the disneyland hotel on saturday and cost $ 520 to attend for non-members . a shrine : families of those who died during 9/11 have said it is deeply inappropriate for the national september 11 memorial & museum to accept an award for ` entertainment ' ` it 's totally outrageous that they would participate in this , ' said jim riches , a retired firefighter who lost his son , jimmy on september 11 . speaking to the new york daily news , riches said , ` it 's a moneymaking place for entertainment and they got an award for it . they 've made it into an amusement park . ' furious , riches said that ground zero is a place where almost 3,000 people died , not a theme park ride . ' i do n't think they should have sent somebody there to accept an award for a cemetery , ' riches told cbs2 's alice gainer . ` it 's supposed to be a place that 's dignified and respectful where our loved ones are to be buried . it 's not the metropolitan museum . ' deep emotions : two people embrace during the opening ceremony of the national september 11 memorial in may of 2014 deep significance : united states president barack obama speaks at the dedication ceremony for the national 9/11 memorial museum sacrifice of heroes : destroyed ladder truck of fdny ladder co. 3 is one of many exhibits on display at the 9/11 museum honor guards comprised of members of fdny , nypd , and papd entering the stage during the opening ceremony of the 9/11 museum last year before the announcement the 9/11 museum revealed it had welcomed two million visitors since opening last may , most of whom are charged $ 24 to view exhibits detailing the attack and the aftermath - culminating in the death of osama bin laden in 2011 . ` the 9/11 museum won this award alongside a harry potter theme park . it 's time for professionals like the national park service to bring dignity and respect to the world trade center museum and get rid of the high-salaried stuffed suits who are disrespecting the dead heroes and victims at ground zero , ' said retired nypd sgt. al regenhard in a statement to the new york daily news . al and his wife sally said that they were deeply disappointed by the 9/11 museum and want it to stop storing victim 's unidentified body parts there if they want to go to california to accept entertainment awards . ` what more evidence do the grieving 9/11 families need that their loved one 's precious remains are being desecrated in a freak show at ground zero ? ' they said in their statement . ` this award just shows the 9/11 museum heads have a moral compass that points to money rather than ethics . ' closure : this uniform shirt was worn by the navy seal team 6 member who killed osama bin laden in pakistan in may , 2011 , and is on display at the museum theme park : this is the permanently snow-capped hogsmeade village at the wizarding world of harry potter which won the top award at the disneyland ceremony the museum was honored for its international impact in raising awareness for the tragic events of 9/11 . ` the award recognizes the museum for extraordinary cultural achievement , and it is an honor to continue to be acknowledged around the world as an institution having a global impact , ' the museum said in a statement . the 9/11 museum emphasized that they accepted no money for the award , but this is just the latest controversy the embattled exhibition has encountered . when it opened in may , many were angered by a gift shop which sells coffee mugs and t-shirts , all themed around september 11 . indeed , when asked , visitors to the site on monday said they did not think the museum should have accepted the award . ` if it offends families who have victims from 9/11 then they should n't accept the award , ' said sam allen of colorado to cbs .
two of britain 's most distinguished actors are set to star in a # 6million film ` co-written ' by a leading figure of the jihadi john apologist campaign group , cage . sir ben kingsley and emily watson will be working alongside an award-winning team in ` the secret evidence ' . golden globe-winning producer j todd harris is said to already be on board , and the film has commitments from emily watson , sir ben and lily collins . actors sir ben kingsley and emily watson are among stars to have signed up to the film that has been reportedly co-written by the cage spokesman last night the mail was unable to contact representatives of the stars , who are believed to have made the commitment to the movie long before the controversy surrounding cage . the film , which is supported by civil rights group liberty , is thought to have been co-written by former terror suspect and cage spokesman cerie bullivant . he spent two years under a control order before eventually being exonerated , and the film is believed to be loosely based on his own experiences . but mr bullivant 's involvement became an embarrassment for the movie after the unmasking of mohammed emwazi as jihadi john . last month cage sparked outrage by defending the london-raised fanatic unmasked as the islamic state butcher . the group described emwazi as a ` beautiful and gentle ' man who was driven to radicalisation by mi5 . promotion : the leaflet for the film showing miss watson , saoirse ronan and sir ben kingsley and mr bullivant railed for eight minutes about the treatment he had received at the hands of the security services ` in very similar circumstances ' to those of emwazi , suggesting it was the mi5 's actions which had led to the brutal killer 's radicalisation . the former mental health nurse also claimed uk security forces harassed emwazi to the point where he had ` no options and position within uk society anymore ' in an official video for cage . he even went as far as suggesting an alleged assault on emwazi by the police in 2010 could be directly linked to the beheadings . speaking to the islam channel earlier this month , the 32-year-old said : ` he was looking to get married , get a good job and settle down . ` if that had happened , if our security forces had not had stopped him , would he be cutting off heads now ? ' he added : ` we have a two year picture of a man constantly ... trying to move his life forward and we see a pattern of security services stopping that . ` we even see a pattern of the police pinning him up against the wall and strangling him . this is a chilling simile when you look at what he ended up doing to other people . ' cerie bullivant is a former terror suspect and spokesman for the group cage bullivant was in the spotlight again earlier this month when he stormed off in the middle of a live sky news interview claiming a question on about his feelings on the beheadings was racist . now the filmmakers behind ` the secret evidence ' appear to be trying to distance themselves from bullivant -- perhaps fearing that the link with him could damage their chances of securing the # 1million still required to begin production this year . the mail has seen a document , which was presented to potential investors as recently as last summer , clearly stating that the film was ` co-written by cerie bullivant ' . and an invitation to a high-profile event due to be held at the chiltern firehouse restaurant in london tonight to attract potential investors -- which was sent out earlier this month -- said : ` it was co-written by cerie bullivant , who was wrongly sent to belmarsh at 23 . ' however , the next day the same invitation was sent out again -- but with the line mentioning cerie bullivant deleted . the film 's award-winning director nicholas racz admitted that the invite to tonight 's event was edited . he said : ` cerie generously said there was no reason for him to be mentioned . it was an association that was n't helpful to the movie . ' he added : ` cerie 's involvement was some five years ago where he was involved as a co-writer . this was before his involvement with cage and the movie is not based on his life . ` he has contributed to the script , absolutely , and he will still be paid for that if the film is made but it wo n't be a significant amount of money . ' and liberty director shami chakrabarti , who is helping to host the film 's fundraising event tonight , admitted bullivant had ` some involvement ' in the film . she explained : ` my understanding is that cerie bullivant is one of a number of stories that inspired this film . ' however she went on to say : ` whatever you may think of cerie bullivant , he did suffer a miscarriage of justice many years ago , and there will continue to be many more miscarriages of justice if we continue down this path . ` fiction is more powerful than anything and i really hope this is a great inspiring film exposing secret courts and secret justice . ' bullivant described isis executioner mohammed emwazi as a ` beautiful man ' after his identity was revealed

dusseldorf , germany ( cnn ) years before he was at the controls of a germanwings plane that plunged into the french alps , andreas lubitz told the airline he worked for that he 'd had a bout with depression . lubitz , the co-pilot of germanwings flight 9525 who authorities accuse of deliberately crashing the plane , told his lufthansa flight training school in 2009 that he had a " previous episode of severe depression , " the airline said tuesday . email correspondence between lubitz and the school discovered in an internal investigation , lufthansa said , included medical documents he submitted in connection with resuming his flight training . the announcement indicates that lufthansa , the parent company of germanwings , knew of lubitz 's battle with depression , allowed him to continue training and ultimately put him in the cockpit . lufthansa , whose ceo previously said lubitz was 100 % fit to fly , described its statement tuesday as a " swift and seamless clarification " and said it was sharing the information and documents -- including training and medical records -- with public prosecutors . what was mental state of germanwings co-pilot ? it 's a development that will likely be a part of the crash investigation , but it 's only one piece of the puzzle , cnn aviation correspondent richard quest said . " we need to know what happened after he returned in 2009 and finished his training , because that tells us whether there was the correct procedure and process , " he said . a lufthansa spokesperson told cnn on tuesday that lubitz had a valid medical certificate , had passed all his examinations and " held all the licenses required . " check out the latest from our correspondents the details about lubitz 's correspondence with the flight school during his training were among several developments as investigators continued to delve into what caused the crash and lubitz 's possible motive for downing the jet . earlier , a spokesman for the prosecutor 's office in dusseldorf said lubitz suffered from suicidal tendencies at some point before his aviation career . medical records reveal that lubitz was suicidal at one time and underwent psychotherapy before he got his pilot 's license , prosecutor 's spokesman christoph kumpa said . kumpa emphasized there 's no evidence suggesting lubitz was suicidal or acting aggressively before the crash . investigators are looking into whether lubitz feared his medical condition would cause him to lose his pilot 's license , a european government official briefed on the investigation into last week 's crash told cnn on tuesday . while flying was " a big part of his life , " the source said , it 's only one theory being considered . another source , a law enforcement official briefed on the investigation , also told cnn that authorities believe the primary motive for lubitz to bring down the plane was that he feared he would not be allowed to fly because of his medical problems . lubitz 's girlfriend told investigators he had seen an eye doctor and a neuropsychologist , both of whom deemed him unfit to work recently and concluded he had psychological issues , the european government official said . lubitz told the neuropsychologist that he was too stressed with work , the official said . but no matter what details emerge about his previous mental health struggles , there 's more to the story , said brian russell , a forensic psychologist . " psychology can explain why somebody would turn rage inward on themselves about the fact that maybe they were n't going to keep doing their job and they 're upset about that and so they 're suicidal , " he said . " but there is no mental illness that explains why somebody then feels entitled to also take that rage and turn it outward on 149 other people who had nothing to do with the person 's problems . " reports say a cell phone video shows the nightmarish final seconds of germanwings flight 9525 , but a police spokesman said the accounts were " completely wrong . " french magazine paris match and german newspaper bild reported that a video recovered from a phone at the wreckage site showed the inside of the plane moments before it crashed . " one can hear cries of ` my god ' in several languages , " paris match reported . " metallic banging can also be heard more than three times , perhaps of the pilot trying to open the cockpit door with a heavy object . towards the end , after a heavy shake , stronger than the others , the screaming intensifies . the two publications described the video , but did not post it on their websites . the publications reported that they watched the video , which was found by a source close to the investigation . " it is a very disturbing scene , " said julian reichelt , editor-in-chief of bild online . an official with france 's accident investigation agency , the bea , said the agency is not aware of any such video . lt. col. jean-marc menichini , a french gendarmerie spokesman in charge of communications on rescue efforts around the germanwings crash site , told cnn that the reports were " completely wrong " and " unwarranted . " cell phones have been collected at the site , he said , but that they " had n't been exploited yet . " menichini said he believed the cell phones would need to be sent to the criminal research institute in rosny sous-bois , near paris , in order to be analyzed by specialized technicians working hand-in-hand with investigators . but none of the cell phones found so far have been sent to the institute , menichini said . asked whether staff involved in the search could have leaked a memory card to the media , menichini answered with a categorical " no . " reichelt told " erin burnett : outfront " that he had watched the video and stood by the report , saying bild and paris match are " very confident " that the clip is real . he noted that investigators only revealed they 'd recovered cell phones from the crash site after bild and paris match published their reports . " that is something we did not know before . ... overall we can say many things of the investigation were n't revealed by the investigation at the beginning , " he said . while investigators search for clues to lubitz 's motivation , recovery workers continue the grim task of searching for the remains of those killed in the march 24 crash . the remains of at least 78 people on board the plane have been identified so far using dna analysis . naffrechoux warned monday that " it may not be possible to find the human remains of all the 150 passengers , as some of them may have been pulverized by the crash . " but french president francois hollande , speaking alongside german chancellor angela merkel in berlin , was more positive , saying that it should be possible to identify all the victims by the end of the week . a simple stone memorial has been set up at le vernet , where grieving relatives of those killed have laid flowers and held prayers . germanwings crash compensation : what we know who was the captain of germanwings flight 9525 ? the bea , france 's accident investigation agency , said its ongoing safety investigation was focusing on a more detailed analysis of the flight history leading up to the crash , based on the audio recovered from the cockpit voice recorder and any other available data . " a deliberate act by a man with a disturbed psychological profile is a possible scenario , " bea spokeswoman martine del bono told cnn . " the first step of the investigation is to describe more precisely what happened . " this will be based mainly on analysis of the cockpit voice recorder , to be supplemented by data from the flight data recorder if it is found , she said . " but we will also look at other events with possibly similar scenarios , try to understand if there are systemic weaknesses which may contribute or facilitate such scenarios . " we will in particular look at the cockpit door locking as well as the criteria and procedures applied to detect specific psychological profiles . " cnn 's pamela brown reported from dusseldorf and frederik pleitgen from cologne , while catherine e. shoichet wrote from atlanta . cnn 's laura smith-spark , josh levs , pamela boykoff , antonia mortensen , sandrine amiel , margot haddad , anna-maja rappard and mariano castillo contributed to this report .

being made redundant makes people less willing to trust others for up to a decade afterwards , according to a study . losing a job in this way dents trust so badly that even finding new work fails to overcome the problem , the researchers found . it suggests that , even in later life , people can struggle to get over a firing in their life . the study was carried out by the university of manchester . they found being made redundant made people less willing to trust others ( stock image shown ) . people still showed the effect years after losing their job . ` trauma like redundancy can shift people 's outlook of the world , ' said dr james laurence of the university study author dr james laurence , from the university of manchester , said : ` people 's willingness to trust others tends to remain largely stable over their lifetime . ` however , this work shows that trauma like redundancy can shift people 's outlook of the world and this change persists long after the experience occurred . ` society is still recovering from one of the longest recessions this century and much has been discussed in counting the economic costs of that . ` even a single experience of redundancy can lead to depressed trust and what is particularly concerning is that people reported less willingness to trust others even after they got another job . no matter how good your cv , it 's your voice that may actually help you land the job . researchers found recruiters rated candidates as more competent , thoughtful and intelligent when they heard the pitch than when they read it - even when the words used were exactly the same . they also discovered evaluators who listened to trained actors reading job candidates ' written pitches out loud believed those candidates were more intelligent and wanted to hire them more than the evaluators who read candidates ' own written pitches . the new study by university of chicago booth school of business professor nicholas epley and phd candidate juliana schroeder also found the addition of video did not influence evaluations beyond hearing the candidate 's voice . ` this has important implications not just for the person involved but for society as a whole as trust can have significant benefits , from health and happiness , to social cohesion , efficient democratic governance and economic development . ' the study , which was published in the journal social science research , involved data from almost 7,000 british adults followed as part of the national child development study of adults born in march 1958 . responses from 1991 , when the individuals were 33 , were compared with responses from 2008 , when they were 50 , noting whether they had experienced involuntary job loss from redundancy , downsizing or restructuring in the period in between . their responses showed that at age 50 , those who had been made redundant were 4.5 per cent less likely to express trust in others than those who had not been laid off . among those who said at the age of 33 that it was very important to be in work , the figure rose to seven per cent . to find out how long the effect of redundancy continues , the data was split into groups according to the age they were laid off : ages 33-41 ( but not 41-50 ) ; 41-50 ( but not 33-41 ) and both 33-41 and 41-50 . their responses showed that at age 50 , those who had been made redundant were 4.5 per cent less likely to express trust in others than those who had not been laid off ( stock image shown ) . among those who said at the age of 33 that it was very important to be in work , the figure rose to seven per cent ` we observe that experiencing displacement within any age group has a significant negative effect on trust , ' said dr laurence . ` importantly , individuals who experienced displacement between the ages of 33-41 but not 41-50 are therefore also likely to report lower trust at age 50 . ` this is suggestive that the effect of displacement can persist at least nine years after the event occurred . ' he added : ` the greater the attachment to employment , the stronger the negative effect of displacement . ` a range of mediators , such as physical health , mental well-being , and personal efficacy , do not appear to account for the effect . ` that the effect remains present at least nine years after the even occurred demonstrates the severity of displacement experiences .

the father of real madrid youngster jack harper has revealed that spain have been in contact over his son 's international status following the 19-year-old 's scotland snub . harper was a shock omission from ricky sbragia 's scotland under 19 squad ahead of key clashes against austria , italy and croatia with the former sunderland manager citing ` purely tactical ' reasons . now , harper 's father john has warned scotland that they could be in danger of losing his son to the spanish national side . real madrid youngster jack harper has been left out of the latest scotland under 19 squad scotland under 19s manager ricky sbragia claimed the reasons were ` purely tactical ' among harper 's coaches at real madrid are former france international zinedine zidane ( centre ) he told the daily record : ` the day after scotland announced the under 19 squad , and jack was n't included , spain were on the phone asking about his position and international status . ` their national academy is just a few miles from real madrid 's own training ground , so they know about jack because they watch his team often enough . ' despite being left out of sbragia 's latest uefa under 19 championship squad , harper 's father insists that the madrid starlet remains committed to scotland . john added : ` jack wants to play for scotland . i 'm scottish , so is his mum and the rest of the family . he is committed to scotland , but if nothing is happening by the time he is 21 then he will have a decision to make because he has a life and a career to fulfil . hopefully , it wo n't come to that . ' harper 's father was contacted by spain shortly after his son 's international snub sbragia also still believes harper , who was born in spain , has a big future ahead of him in a scotland shirt . he said : ` he 's an exceptionally gifted lad , but sometimes we ca n't carry him . he can be a luxury sometimes . in some cases , if it 's going well , he can be a good luxury . ' ` listen , jack 's time will come . the last time i spoke to him , he wanted to really settle in at real madrid and find a place there . that 's been a big thing for him . ` i 've gone with the boys i 've seen most in the last six months . we keep tabs on jack and see video clips of him . we have people over there who keep their eye on him . ` there are others i 've left out like dominic thomas at motherwell who will have gripes that they 're not in the squad . ` but i 've picked a group of 18 which will hopefully do well for us . it 's my opinion and i 'm not saying it 's right . but the squad i 've picked is an extremely strong one .

juan mata struck twice for manchester united as liverpool were dealt a major blow to their top-four hopes and captain steven gerrard was sensationally sent off within seconds of coming on . ander herrera 's through ball found mata on 14 minutes for the opener as louis van gaal 's side got off to the perfect start . brendan rodgers brought on the experience and leadership of his captain gerrard for the second half , but in less than a minute he was soon walking off in disgrace after a stamp on ander herrera . star man juan mata celebrates his spectacular second goal in manchester united 's 2-1 win over liverpool mata scored a brilliant second in the 59th minute as he met angel di maria 's chip into the box with a horizontal volley perfectly buried at the far post , giving simon mignolet no chance . daniel sturridge weighed in with an opportunistic finish that gave liverpool hope but was n't enough to prevent united securing a five-point gap between the rivals either side of the champions league qualification places . sportsmail 's chris wheeler was at anfield to assess all the players ' performances . phil jones posted a picture with mata to twitter and said : ` great result today ! this man was unbelievable ! ' unlucky not to keep out mata 's first goal but had absolutely no chance with the second . brilliant penalty save from wayne rooney in stoppage time . liverpool keeper simon mignolet almost saves mata 's right-footed strike that put the reds behind 1-0 had his hands full with fellaini in the first half . guilty of bringing down blind for the late penalty . coped well with rooney on the whole . frustration got the better of him when he was involved in a tussle with de gea at the final whistle . emre can ( left ) dealt with marouane fellaini in the first half but fouled daley blind ( right ) for the penalty not always the most composed of defenders , but fought until the end and gave very little away . wasted liverpool 's best chance of the match after being on the receiving end of a crunching challenge from jones , and replaced by gerrard at half-time . liverpool 's adam lallana fails to hit the target with his side 's best first-half chance at anfield gave away possession cheaply on several occasions and was booked for trying to win it back from herrera . battled to keep his side in the game after gerrard 's red card . unlucky not to connect with moreno 's cross in the first half . slack pass early on set the tone for his performance . spaniard was caught out of position when mata fired united ahead . liverpool 's stand-in captain jordan henderson holds off fellaini during a spirited midfield battle much was expected of the england star but he failed to deliver after de gea saved at his feet early on . took his chance well to bring liverpool back into the game after swinging wildly at a volley when opportunity knocked in the first half . subdued by his standards on sunday , raheem sterling is pressured by manchester united 's ashley young daniel sturridge buries this opportunistic chance with a deflection of jones ' foot to peg one back liverpool 's best player , always pushing and probing . no surprise that the goal came from his incisive pass to sturridge . in-form liverpool forward philippe coutinho was his side 's standout player and set-up sturridge 's goal manager - brendan rodgers : 5 has to take responsibility for the fact liverpool simply did n't turn up in the first half and played so cautiously . steven gerrard ( for lallana 46 , 1 ) , balotelli ( for moreno 65 , 4 ) substitutes not used : jones , johnson , toure , lambert , lucas gerrard clatters into juan mata in a crunching tackle moments before his sending off after 38 seconds showed great anticipation to snuff out the danger when liverpool threatened . will be annoyed to have been beaten by sturridge at his near post . another rock-solid display from the ecuadorian who hardly put a foot wrong after a brief stumble almost let in liverpool early on . manchester united keeper david de gea saves at the feet of sterling as he snuffs out another liverpool attack one of his stronger performances . the england defender even got forward on occasions . floored lallana with a full-blooded challenge in the first half and was fortunate to only get a yellow card for a wild tackle on henderson in the second . made a couple of fine interception tackles early in the game and rarely looked troubled after that . united defender phil jones is lucky to only be booked after this reckless challenge on henderson antonio valencia protects the ball from lallana as united hold out a late liverpool resurgence kept united ticking over from the base of midfield but was guilty of being caught in possession for liverpool 's goal . what a day for the little spaniard . he produced a composed finish to put united ahead and a spectacular one for the decisive second goal . man-of-the-match juan mata spectacularly volleys from a horizontal position for what would be the winner wonderful defence-splitting pass to set up the first goal . another impressive display but booked over the incident that saw gerrard sent off . did what he does best , getting on the end of long balls and scrapping for everything . particularly effective in the first half . marouane fellaini towers over liverpool 's joe allen as the belgian scraps for everything for united a peripheral figure on the left and replaced by di maria less than 10 minutes into the second half . anfield has never been his happiest hunting ground and was a little disappointing again , seeing his injury-time penalty saved . wayne rooney was a little disappointing again at anfield and had his penalty saved late on by mignolet manager - louis van gaal : 7 the dutchman will remember his first game in charge at anfield fondly . it could prove pivotal in qualifying for the champions league . substitutes : rojo ( for blind 90 +4 ) , di maria ( for young 55 , 7 ) , falcao ( for herrera 83 , 6.5 ) substitutes not used : valdes , rafael , januzaj , pereira got the big decisions right , sending off steven gerrard and awarding united a late penalty . referee martin atkinson got the big decisions right , including the dramatic sending off of gerrard
roberto martinez has encouraged everton 's squad to make history and overcome the problems he believes are preventing english clubs from thriving in europe . everton 's sole european trophy came in the 1985 european cup - winners ' cup and martinez wants to mark that anniversary by guiding his team to the europa league final . they will reach the last eight by avoiding defeat against dynamo kiev on thursday night . given how wretched their domestic form has been , few would have thought everton could be the barclays premier league 's last european representatives and martinez feels they have overcome huge obstacles to get this far . everton boss roberto martinez has expressed concerns over the quality of dynamo kiev 's pitch everton players train ahead of their europa league round of 16 second-leg with dynamo kiev everton currently lead the tie 2-1 on aggregate following their win at goodison park in the first-leg premier league sides have won only five of the 28 european trophies possible since the turn of the millennium and the manager believes the punishing nature of the domestic competition is taking its toll . ` our british competition demands every game to be 100 per cent , ' said martinez . ` teams that play in other leagues in europe , they cruise through games and get through at 50 per cent . it is unfair on british teams . ` a break in the winter would enable the players to regenerate and refresh -- a key period in the season is february and march so i think the biggest teams are a little bit unfairly treated . the answer is clear -- you need to have a bigger squad at this level where you can make five or six changes to keep the team performing at the same level . with the pitch covered up , everton players are made to train on the running track that surrounds it a cold night in kiev awaits everton as they look to protect their 2-1 lead from the first leg martinez has warned that the poor quality pitch could be a problem for both everton and dynamo kiev ` i find playing thursday and sunday is tough . the europa league teams should play at least at 4pm , and also be given as many home games as possible after they have been away . we should protect our teams a bit more , otherwise we shoot ourselves in the foot . ' progress in kiev will not be straightforward . everton were unable to train on the olympic stadium pitch last night as it was covered in huge white tarpaulins and had heat lamps ready to repair a surface reported to be rain-sodden . martinez , however , is not going to use the pitch as an excuse , as he is far more anxious about the threat dynamo pose . sergei rebrov 's side have not lost at home this season but everton will not be cautious in their approach . an everton coach leads the players in a series of stretches on the running track around the pitch leighton baines ( left ) sretches alongside everton team-mate luke garbutt ( right ) at the olympic stadium ` we have got great memories of being in europe this season , ' said martinez . ` this experience has been fantastic and we want to progress . ` it is an opportunity , something for us to enjoy rather than fear . we want to show everyone what we can do . ' there is little doubt the 2-1 first-leg win against dynamo , followed by a 3-0 dismantling of newcastle , has improved the atmosphere in the squad and helped restore confidence . ` it was brilliant to get those two results back to back , ' said everton defender seamus coleman . ` we have n't been happy with our league form but it is turning . ` we played ever so hard to get into this competition . our goal at the start was to win it . it has been a long time since the club won anything and it would be nice if we could change that .

as selma prepared to commemorate the 50th anniversary of ` bloody sunday , ' so too did the ku klux klan who 've distributed almost 4,000 fliers of the organization 's hate-literature to area homes over the last two weeks . robert jones , the grand dragon for the loyal white knights of the kkk confirmed the campaign in press interviews . ` we pretty much put out fliers , some against king and some against immigration , ' he told reporters . ` it 's time for the american people to wake up to these falsehoods that they preach about mlk . ' the kkk distributed thousands of fliers on the selma march anniversary in hopes of recruiting new members at al.com , jones went on to claims bags with the flier and a rock - the latter meant as paperweight - were thrown at people 's homes from passing cars . meanwhile thousands came to selma to walk over the edmund pettus bridge to honor the battle between police and civil rights leaders . ` everybody has a right to gather in this country , freedom of speech , ' he said of the selma gathering , adding that the marchers commemorating martin luther king , jr. 's work and legacy were ` supporting a man they do n't know about . ' as the kkk spread hate , marches headed across the edmund pettus bridge to honor the legacy of selma 's civil rights leaders ` the klan is still out there and we are watching , ' he said , hoping that the fliers would attract new members . however several of the people living on selma avenue took that as a threat , and called the police .
europe 's top human rights watchdog is to rebuke france for its failure to explicitly ban smacking children it was claimed last night . french law forbids violence against children , but recognises the parents ' ` right to discipline ' children . the council of europe is expected to say that the laws on corporal punishment are ` not sufficiently clear , binding and specific ' , according to le monde newspaper . the council of europe is expected to say that the french laws , which forbids violence against children , but recognises the parents ' ` right to discipline ' children are ` not sufficiently clear ' it follows a complaint by british children 's charity approach , which argues that france and other council members are violating a section of the european social charter calling on signatories to protect children . the council did not comment last night . it is to issue its formal ruling on wednesday . the council has called for all of its 47 members to ban corporal punishment of children . so far , 22 have banned the practice . it follows a complaint by british children 's charity approach , which argues that france and other council members are violating a section of the european social charter calling on signatories to protect children the laws in france have occasionally caused controversy . in 2013 , a father was fined $ 500 ( $ 560 ; # 364 ) for spanking his nine-year-old son , a case that reignited the debate about corporal punishment in france . the council of europe is due to announce its decisions on other countries included in the approach complaint in may .
scotland yard detectives swooped on the family home of field marshall lord bramall of bushfield , the former chief of the defence staff and a d-day veteran former defence chief lord bramall today dismissed any suggestion of his involvement in child abuse as ` absolutely a load of rubbish ' . the ex-chief of defence staff said he was ` mystified ' about why the police had searched his home in surrey . detectives from the metropolitan police 's operation midland have also raided the homes of tory grandee leon brittan and former mp harvey proctor . operation midland is investigating claims boys senior members of the establishment abused young men and boys in london and the south of england in the 1970s and 1980s . it includes claims that sex parties involving boys below the age of consent were held at the exclusive dolphin square apartment block near the houses of parliament . the operation includes detectives from the child abuse investigation command and the homicide and major crime command . it is also examining allegations three young men were murdered , at 91 , lord bramall -- the latest vip to be dragged into the sex abuse inquiry -- is the oldest and most respected of britain 's eight living field marshals . he stepped down as chief of defence staff in 1985 after four decades spent climbing the ranks from 2nd lieutenant right to the pinnacle of britain 's armed forces . officers from operation midland searched his home last wednesday . he told the bbc : ` categorically , never have i had a connection or anything to do with the matters being investigated . it is not in my character or my psyche . ' he said : ' i know i have only had sex with someone other than my own sex . ' he added that any suggestion he was involved in child abuse was ` absolutely a load of rubbish ' . he said he had been to events at dolphin square ` four or fives times ' but only once went into an apartment there . he has not been arrested , named as a suspect by police or questioned . lord bramall first saw action on the normandy beaches the day after d-day , when he was shelled . everyone else in his vehicle died but he managed to crawl out . at first he thought he was on fire , but in fact he was badly wounded and was sent back to britain for treatment . lord bramall returned to his unit just five weeks later and was leading a patrol on the dutch-belgian border when he was ambushed . rather than flee , he led a counter-attack , and managed to wound two germans and take another one captive . he was later awarded the military cross for his actions by field marshal montgomery himself . he led the royal green jackets in borneo in 1965 , commanded british forces in hong kong in the 1970s and was made head of the army in 1979 . lord bramall held that role during the falklands war of 1982 , and was a strong admirer of margaret thatcher . ' a wonderful war leader , ' he said , ` probably even better than churchill ' . he married his wife avril in 1949 and they have two children . the couple are still together . after he retired , festooned with decorations , he became a life peer -- and has never been afraid to speak his mind in the lords -- opposing the second war in iraq and what he termed ` mission creep ' in afghanistan . more recently , lord bramall has also been a vocal critic of defence cuts , which he fears could weaken the army . he told peers that when it comes to dealing with threats you ` have to prepare for the unexpected ' . harvey proctor insisted he was a ` discreet ' man and had never been part of ` any rent boy ring ' with cabinet ministers , mps or military top brass the search of lord bramall 's home took place on the same day as officers searched the leicestershire home of ex-tory mp harvey proctor , 68 , prompting him to publicly deny any wrongdoing . proctor , whose parliamentary career ended in a rent boy ` spanking ' scandal , said he was trapped in a ` kafka-esque fantasy ' . more than 1,000 people have been questioned by police investigating claims of historic sex abuse . the huge number , including suspects , victims and witnesses , lays bare the scale of the task facing detectives . scotland yard boss sir bernard hogan-howe admitted the wave of allegations is consuming a huge amount of resources . but he pledged to get to the heart of the claims , no matter who was involved . speaking on lbc radio , sir bernard said his staff were ` determinedly working their way through ' all the evidence , adding : ` we 've now interviewed at least 1,000 people . ' asked whether the huge amount of resources required could be justified , he said victims deserve answers . ` what we can not do is ignore people who were ignored 30 years ago , ' he said . sir bernard added that police ` have to prioritise ' but nevertheless have ` put tens of officers into these inquiries ' . he said : ` we have got both witnesses and suspects that are scattered to the four winds . they are not grouped geographically like they were 30 years ago . ` but we will get to the bottom of it , i am sure we will , so far as it is possible . ' sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article .
a quarter of us suffer from ` sunday night insomnia ' -- and it 's all down to our fears of starting a new working week . even commuting causes fretful nights , with 10 per cent of britons too worried about their journey to work on mondays to enjoy a proper night 's rest , a study has found . on average , britons manage just six and a half hours ' sleep a night , which is far less than the recommended eight hours . more than half only get four hours sleep or less . a quarter of britons suffer from ` sunday night insomnia ' as we are too scared to start a new working week the study , carried out by the tune hotels group , reveals a nation suffering from a sleep deficit due to the anxieties about the start of a new working week . jason ellis , professor of sleep science at northumbria university , said : ` as a general rule , the average person needs around eight hours sleep a night to feel the full restorative benefits . ` this is particularly true of people who have very physically or mentally challenging jobs .

years ago , when our house was always full of small children , i staggered downstairs with a couple of fellow mothers after a chaotic communal bath-time and found the visiting dads pouring well-earned drinks . we reported that , just before we battened down the hatches , all the three and four-year-old boys had been snapping at their pyjama elastic and comparing the size of their willies . so did the fathers , for a brief moment , but then , in chorus , they ask ™ ed : ` um ... and whose was the ... ? ' civilized , cultured , happily married men , not a porn-hound or a libertine among them , but they could n't help it . willy-worship , willy-pride , is hard-wired deep in the male brain . however much they deny it , men do seem to care . actors jonny lee miller ( left ) and benedict cumberbatch ( right ) were subject to much speculation and discussion after their stark-naked performances as frankenstein a few years ago why else would king 's college london have bothered to trot around 15,000 men with a tape measure ( one hopes not the hard , cold , sharp steel sort ) and proudly report that the average length , unstimulated , is 3.6 in and 5.16 in erect . i do admire the chaps ' willingness to collaborate in that measurement in the presence of a researcher with a white coat and a ruler . but the very fact that 15,000 men were happy to go through this bizarre academic exercise shows that they mind about their little friends . and that they all secretly , privately hoped that their willy would be bigger than average . the academics explain that it 's all about ` using the graphs to examine the discrepancy between what a man believes to be their position on the graph and their actual position ' , and that it will be very helpful to worried guys with body dysmorphic disorder , and to those prone to ordering the wrong size of prophylactic online . so , do n't tell me men do n't care . further evidence was provided when some of us managed to see both versions of the astonishing frankenstein play at the national theatre a few years ago , in which on alternate nights the role of the creature , stark-naked during a long opening scene , was taken by benedict cumberbatch and jonny lee miller . conversations between the male viewers who saw both were predictable , centring on who won that particular contest , and including the immortal line in a theatre-bar argument . ` ah yes , i see what you mean , but is it a show-er or a grower ? ' we women edged away , to continue our serious analysis of which of the buff actors made the most alluring and convincing monster and which was best at being dr frankenstein . libby says she blames author , jilly cooper ( pictured ) , for giving men the impression that women are worried about size though to be fair , some of the girls were admiring the surrounding abs , pecs , and glutes . we do like a man who looks healthy . it 's a primitive need in the female to bond with a man who is going to be able to take the bins out unaided . but honestly , hand on heart , i suspect that very few of us during early courtship -- or afterwards , or even after the golden wedding -- are particularly worried about whether we are getting the full 3.6 in average . the idea that we are waiting with a ruler and a scornful frown for the kecks to come off is miles from reality . i blame author jilly cooper for giving men that impression , with all her crazed descriptions of things rearing up like the tower of pisa , or space shuttles , or -- my least favourite -- a ` joyous otter ' . i suppose the trouble is that writing sex scenes you have few choices . you can resort to heavy innuendo , or do some barbara cartland stuff about being carried away to heaven on wings of bliss . or you can throw in the towel and pretend the female eye will only be delighted by the spectacle of something that would fit neatly into the london or manhattan skyline , somewhere between centrepoint and the gherkin . though ideally , of course , not the shard . the porn industry is obsessed with size , but anyone with half a brain and heart knows porn has little to do with the reality of lovemaking . most of us have never cared about size . we do n't carry on like the fearsome coven on tv 's sex and the city , shriekingly comparing notes in the back of taxis or skinny-muffin cafes . it is worth noting , without comment , that much of the genius behind those series and films came from -- ahem -- men . gay men , in many cases . out here in the real world , that is not the way women carry on . the only ones i 've ever known talk about male size were sad , angry girls , unhappy in themselves about their failure to bond happily with any of the possessors of the said tackle . libby is keen to point out that most women do n't carry on like the women in sex and the city ( pictured ) , comparing detailed notes on the men they know what we like is much harder to measure . i know a lot of women , and have been one for ages , and it 's simpler than you think . we like hugs , we like tenderness , we like men who seem ( often bafflingly ) to be delighted and aroused by the very sight of us , even without make-up and a heavy cold . we really like to be laughed into bed and treated with affectionate consideration once we 're there . we like men who think our enjoyment is at least half the point of the exercise , if not a bit more . we approve of chaps , of any dimension , who work out how to make the main event fun all round . we like men who chat and do n't mind being rolled over when they snore or hauled around when they have hogged the duvet . we like faithfulness and kindness , and a man who loves to cuddle the baby even when it 's leaking a bit . and we really like it when they grow out of caring about the 3.6 in , or expecting it to be worshipped .
ikea is to launch a range of desks , tables and lamps that will wirelessly charge mobile phones . the swedish furniture giant revealed today that the new collection will use qi wireless technology to power-up compatible devices that are placed on or near the furniture . the home spot range of desks , bedside tables and lamps will hit stores in europe and north america next month - with an international roll-out set to follow . latest range : swedish furniture giant ikea said the new collection would use qi wireless technology to charge devices that are placed on or near the furniture recipe : the home spot range of desks , bedside tables and lamps will hit stores in europe and north america next month - with an international roll-out set to follow jeanette skjelmose , ikea 's lighting and wireless charging business area manager , said : ` through research and home visits , we know that people hate cable mess . ` they worry about not finding the charger and running out of power . our new innovative solutions , which integrate wireless charging into home furnishings , will make life at home simpler . ' qi is said by its developers to be the most widely-used wireless charging type , and can be used in 3,000 public locations globally . there are now more than 80 qi-enabled smartphones available . among these are models of the nokia lumia , samsung galaxy , google nexus and sharp aquos . in the spotlight : qi is said by its developers to be the most widely-used wireless charging type , and can be used in 3,000 public locations globally starting out : one technology industry analyst said it was a ` very early time in the furniture business to blend wireless technology ' menno treffers , chairman of the wireless power consortium - which developed qi - said the new collection shows customers ` the beauty and simplicity of wireless charging ' . the most common type of wireless charging is known as inductive charging , which works on a well-known but rarely-used principle most often seen in electric toothbrushes . it was discovered by british scientist michael faraday in 1831 . mobile phones are using a more advanced version of the technology , which can operate over centimetres , rather than millimetres . the docking station has a coil within the charger , which generates an electrical field around the device . when a suitable mobile phone is placed next to or on top of the station , a coil within the battery resonates with the primary field . it then takes power from the magnetic field and converts and stores it back as electrical energy . he added : ` we applaud ikea for its unmatched insight and their unique passion for making wireless charging affordable and simple for consumers . ' two months ago ikea - which employs 147,000 people worldwide - reported annual profits of $ 3.3 billion ( # 2.4 billion ) for 2014 , unchanged from the year before . one of the designers of the home spot range , david wahl , said : ` we have created smart wireless solutions so you do n't need to see the cables anymore . ` many products can be charged at the same time , but you still have a beautiful wireless home .

former england spinner graeme swann has called on the england and wales cricket board to realise their approach is ` out of date ' , saying that there is a ` stubbornness ' about their selection policy and that they are ` living in the past ' . swann watched on as england slumped to another heavy world cup loss , with sri lanka chasing down their 309 for six with ease , winning with nine wickets and 16 balls to spare . the defeat goes alongside reverses against australia and new zealand , with scotland the only team england have beaten so far . video scroll down to watch cricket world cup highlights : england vs sri lanka former england spinner graeme swann ( pictured in 2013 ) has hit out at the england and wales cricket board wins over afghanistan and bangladesh would take them to the quarter-finals , but swann thinks the problems are evident . writing on twitter , he said : ' a positive thing that can come of this world cup is that maybe the top brass will realise just how out of date our approach is . ' swann also aired his views on bbc radio 5 live , adding that england had been overly pleased to get what he considered to be an average score . ' i think the problem lies not just with the bowling but the whole approach . it was a very self-congratulatory 310 , everyone was saying ` brilliant ' . these days that 's about average and not a great score , ' he said . ` we should be looking for 340 , 350 ; the difference between the top teams and everyone else is immense . they 're saying the is the limit when you bat , we 're still looking at par scores . ' swann feels the answer could lie with former nottinghamshire team-mate alex hales . ` there 's a bit of stubbornness about the selection policy , ' he added . ' i like gary ballance , he 's a great lad , but i think even he 'd admit that he should n't be in the team at the minute , he 's in horrible form . ` we have a lad in alex hales , one of these new generation players who does go out and knock it about , he tries to smash everything for four and six . ` we need to get these young lads playing . we have too many people running it , too many people involved , too many plans and i think we 're just living in the past .

' another ex-england player , geoffrey boycott , said the england team were not being realistic . boycott has long spoken his mind about the national team 's woes , and though he conceded to some positives , he sees plenty of work to be done . he told bbc 5 live : ' i do think we could have got another 20-odd runs , there was a period where we were just cantering around . we are not a force to be reckoned with at all . ` the batting was quite good , but the bowling ? no , no , sorry . it was n't very challenging . ` they 're not bad players , we do n't have a bad side at all . but we 're not firing on all cylinders in any department whatsoever . ` the sad thing for me , even joe root , ( he gave ) a nice interview , lovely lad , but there 's no realism . they keep telling us ` we 'll take the positives , we did well , we did this ' . ` they are trying to tell us little things and we do n't see them . they think ex-players like us are just watching to criticise , we 're not , we want you to win . ` but we can only tell you what we see and you keep losing . ' opinions also reigned in from other nations , with ex-australia spinner shane warne saying on twitter : ` broad & anderson are averaging 80 with the ball you ca n't defend any total , also lacking fire power with bat .

former manchester united player ray wilkins believes radamel falcao has not done enough to earn a permanent deal at the club - and says he looks a shadow of his former self . falcao , on a season-long loan at old trafford from monaco , has been a huge disappointment having notched just four goals in 20 appearances since moving to the barclays premier league . a series of poor performances have seen him left out of louis van gaal 's side of late and with monaco expecting a fee for around # 40million for the former atletico madrid striker in the summer , united face a tough decision over his future . radamel falcao has been a disappointment at manchester united and it looks unlikely that they will sign him ray wilkins can not see united taking up the option of signing falcao with the way his form has been van gaal seems so disappointed in the forward that he left him on the bench away at newcastle united on wednesday night - even when united were desperate for a goal in the closing stages . and former united midfielder wilkins feels that falcao 's days are numbered after failing to convince the club to invest even more money in him . ` falcao has been struggling for goals , ' wilkins told talksport . ` he has n't shown any type of form that we expected when he arrived at manchester united . ' falcao chases down a ball at old trafford , but he has recently found himself benched by louis van gaal sunderland defender patrick van aanholt gets to grips with falcao , who has struggled for form in england the 29-year-old cost monaco over # 40m when signed a year-and-half ago from atletico madrid , where he forged a reputation as a goalscorer and netted a hat-trick against chelsea in the uefa super cup in 2012 . but wilkins says he is nowhere near the standards that he showed at that game in monaco . ` his form has been very poor in fact , we have n't seen anything like the player who absolutely destroyed chelsea with atletico madrid a few years back , ' he said . ` they have already paid a huge loan fee and his wages are extremely expensive . to take him on would require a big fee , i would think they will look elsewhere . ' falcao was at st james ' park for united 's trip to face newcastle united but did n't make it off the bench
radamel falcao 's miserable stint at manchester united hit a new low on tuesday night when he was dumped into the reserves by manager louis van gaal . falcao has not played a minute for united 's first team since being dragged off in the home win over sunderland last month and was left on the bench as van gaal 's team were knocked out of the fa cup by arsenal on monday night . now the # 250,000-a-week loan signing from monaco has suffered the indignity of being made to play in the under 21s against tottenham . he did n't score and was taken off as it ended 1-1 . radamel falcao was humiliated by being dumped in manchester united 's under 21s team on tuesday night louis van gaal could be waving goodbye to falcao in the summer after dropping him to the reserves the colombia striker 's demotion underlines van gaal 's concern over his fitness . the united manager usually asks senior players to play at this level only if they are on their way back from injury . falcao has been injury-free since recovering from a thigh strain in november and is unlikely to be pleased at being asked to drop down a level when he is desperate to prove he is worth a permanent deal . falcao did not manage to get on the scoresheet against tottenham hotspur 's under 21s and was poor the # 250,000-a-week loanee tries to escape from tottenham 's gongani khumalo ( left ) and grant ward ( right ) having scored only four times in six months , falcao 's chances of being retained in the summer are almost nil . but he feels he has not always been given a fair crack of the whip by van gaal . sportsmail reported earlier this year that the 29-year-old feels he has to work twice as hard to impress van gaal than other players . van gaal ( back , left ) did not bring on falcao ( middle , second right ) in monday night 's fa cup defeat to arsenal
a danish sexology professor is calling for students to view pornography films in class as part of changes to the country 's sex education curriculum . professor christian graugaard said the changes would help students understand the differences between what they see in pornography and the reality of sex . his suggestion echoes similar calls made in britain last year by a government-backed sexual health forum , which said youngsters must be taught that pornography does not reflect real life . danish students could soon be watching pornography films in class in order to teach them the differences between what they see on screen and the reality of sex mr graugaard told public broadcaster dr : ` instead of having sex education be boring and technical , where you roll a condom onto a cucumber , i 'd rather have us educate our children to be critical consumers who see porn with a certain distance and reflection , ' according to the local . he added that teenagers attempting to copy what they saw in pornography was a ` recipe for broken necks and disappointment ' . denmark is known for its liberal attitudes to pornography - it was the first country to legalise it , and a recent survey showed three quarters of danish men , and a third of danish women , regularly watch it , the local reported . early last year in britain , a document drawn up by sexual health charity brook , the pshe association and the sex education forum issued new guidelines for sex education in schools . the guidelines , criticised by an education campaigner for ` taking children 's childhoods away from them ' - also called for students to be told about the dangers of ` sexting ' - sending explicit text messages - and sharing sexual photos and images . pupils must instead be taught the difference between real-life relationships and the distorted world of x-rated films . this could involve playing card games in class to decide whether various sexual scenarios belong on ` planet earth ' or ` planet porn ' and a greater emphasis on relationships , sexuality and staying safe , rather than just the ` mechanics ' of reproduction .
a woman broke one of the cardinal rules of flying when she lit up a cigarette on board a flight - much to the dismay of her fellow passengers . the woman , who appears to speak with an american accent has not been named , but was caught on camera smoking on an american airlines flight from nicaragua to miami . and when fellow flyers flagged down a flight attendant to complain about her unruly behavior she blamed someone else for smoking and went on a bizarre rant . smoking : the woman , who appears to speak with an american accent has not been named , but was caught on camera , pictured , smoking on a flight from nicaragua she shouted : ` the united states has declared war on venezuela . venezuela has been declared a national security threat . ' ` you 're a national security threat , ' a passenger remarked off camera . ` she 's gangster ' another passenger said laughing . flight attendants warned the woman that the police would be waiting for her once the plane landed if she did n't calm down , according to the daily dot . she ranted : ` venezuela previously owned the oil in venezuela . my great hero hugo chavez nationalized the oil supply so that people with all of the oil ... not exon mobil would go away ! ' bizarrely , she shouted : ` the people own the oil . ' was n't me : when fellow flyers flagged down a flight attendant to complain about her unruly behavior she blamed someone else for smoking and went on a bizarre rant calm down : a flight attendant , right , warned the woman that the police would be waiting for her once the plane landed if she did n't calm down according to an eyewitness , the woman added that u.s. president barack obama ` kills people on tuesdays . ' after another warning by a flight attendant the woman protested : ' i know already the [ police are coming to take me off the aircraft . ] but before i 'm arrested i 'm going to say my peace . ` they already say they are arresting me so i 'm going to tell you more , ' she told passengers while unbuckling her seat belt and standing up . rant : ` they already say they are arresting me so i 'm going to tell you more , ' she told passengers while unbuckling her seat belt and standing up . her illegal deed was caught on camera by a flyer who then posted the video to youtube and website reddit . the redditor , with the user name ` upside down dog , ' alleged that he was on the same flight as the woman when he recorded her . he wrote : ` while the plane was waiting on the tarmac for the police to arrive , she leans over to me and asks for a cigarette . ` she pulls one out of her bag and lights up . this is the point where i pull eject and run to the back of the cabin . the police arrive after 20 minutes and escort her off the plane . ` she only had a single drink on the plane ( however , others told me she was pounding them back pretty hard in the terminal and she also was on prescription painkillers ) . ` the irony is that this sociology professor is focused mainly on women 's hysteria . due to this , customs was closed just long enough that me and most others on that flight missed our connection . smoking has been strictly prohibited on almost all airlines since 1988 . passengers found to be smoking on non-smoking flights can face a fine up to $ 5,000 and be arrested and detained upon landing .
leicester scrambled to a 16-12 victory over newcastle at kingston park thanks to a controversial try five minutes from time . trailing 12-6 at half-time , freddie burns pulled the tigers back to 12-9 with a 59th-minute penalty and then in the 75th minute launched a crossfield kick into the falcons ' goal area where brothers mathew and alex tait both went for the ball which rebounded for tommy bell to touch down . after a long delay the tmo approved the try and burns converted for leicester to clinch victory and move into the aviva premiership 's top four . alex tait ( left ) and his brother mathew tait compete for the ball which led to leicester 's winning try had newcastle won , london welsh 's relegation would have been confirmed given the exiles lost 74-19 to exeter on saturday . should newcastle lose all six of their remaining fixtures , london welsh would need to win all five of their own and earn a bonus point in at least three of them in order to avoid the drop . despite being under constant pressure up front , newcastle showed they were more than a match for leicester with the ball in hand and mathew tait was left with no alternative but to take tom catterick 's clever kick through into touch right on the leicester line . freddie burns ( centre ) kicks penalty during the aviva premiership match for the tigers at kingston park newcastle promptly drove the line-out effectively for hooker scott lawson to score and catterick converted for 7-0 after 10 minutes . it seemed adam thompstone must score when he cut back inside , but the winger slipped just inside the newcastle 22 and the falcons covered well before richard mayhew was caught offside at a scrum and burns kicked a 15th-minute penalty to make it 7-3 . both vereniki goneva and number eight laurence pearce were making their bulk count with big runs in midfield as leicester dominated possession . scott lawson ( centre on the floor ) celebrates scoring their first try with will welch in the first half but newcastle looked dangerous whenever they had the ball and catterick had the crowd on their feet with a weaving run into the tigers ' 22 before he was stopped . mathew tait ran his brother 's long kick out of defence right back at newcastle and when adam powell went off his feet , burns kicked his second penalty in the 29th minute to make it 7-6 . right on half-time , newcastle showed what they can do within the ball in hand , producing a period of sustained pressure with wingers sinoti sinoti and alex tuilagi making big runs and the latter was inches from scoring . sinoti sinoti ( centre ) crosses the line to score the falcons second try and give them a commanding lead newcastle recycled , lost the ball , recovered it and powell showed real presence of mind to cut back inside and throw a lovely long pass to sinoti for the winger to hurtle over in the corner with two tacklers hanging on . the try was given after the referee went to the tmo and it put newcastle 12-6 up at the break , catterick hitting the post with the conversion from the touchline . newcastle lost two early second half line-outs deep in the tigers ' 22 , and when josh furno was taken out in the line-out , catterick was well short with the 45-metre penalty in the 48th minute . leonardo ghiraldini of leicester ( centre ) feels the full force of a challenge from will welch and gonzalo tiesi they were costly misses as burns slotted a penalty in the 59th minute to make it 12-9 after mark wilson strayed offside . newcastle kicked it straight out from the restart and were penalised at the scrum for collapsing . burns had a chance to level the scores but his kick at goal from halfway was short . leicester stepped up the pressure and burns was nearly through with the falcons showing signs of slipping off the pace . however , they seemed to be hanging on until leicester mounted one last effort and bell got the crucial score in minute 75 . alesana tuilagi attempts to break through a number of leicester tigers tackles during the clash sonatane takukua looks to pass and get newcastle on the attack during the aviva premiership match up

' ehsanullah ehsan , spokesman for the taliban group which ali had joined , vowed to avenge his death which he attributed to isi and its western allies . during his time in pakistan , ali also edited an online english-language jihadist magazine , called ` ihya-e-khilafat ' ( revival of the islamic caliphate ) aimed at recruiting muslim youths from the west . the extremist magazine which he helps to edit publishes contact details for potential jihadi youths and advises them not to use home computers which might be tracked by intelligence agencies . while in the uk , dr ali ( right ) was a close associate of extremist cleric anjem choudary ( left ) as well as a number of uk jihadists who have gone to fight for islamic state in syria tributes : today , british jihadist abu rahin aziz , 33 , who skipped bail last year to join the islamic state in syria , posted pictures on twitter the surgeon was convicted in the first-ever successful prosecution for islamic sectarian violence in britain after he was seen hitting a bystander over the head with a pole at a central london rally in 2013 . but he skipped bail and was found guilty in his absence at the old bailey and sentenced to 15 months . he has since been struck off by the medical practitioners tribunal service ( mpts ) after a hearing in manchester . it was previously reported that he was fighting as a jihadist in syria . but instead he travelled to pakistan where he became a commander for a taliban splinter-group under a new name - dr abu obaidah al-islamabadi . massacre : the attack on the army public school in peshawar in december killed 142 and the taliban admitted responsibility for the atrocity depraved taliban gunmen stormed the school in the north west pakistani city with assault rifles and grenades , before their ` handlers ' ordered them to detonate their suicide vests depraved : the majority of the victims , which included children as young as five , were shot at point blank range in the head or neck wearing a black turban , he was seen in a video clip saying : ` allah blessed me with the passion of jihad . ' i left britain with an intention to go to iraq and join islamic state , but i was arrested on the way and sent to prison in croatia . ' in choudary 's obituary he said : ` once we were acquainted i soon realised that tariq ali was no ordinary muslim but rather in many respects an extremely exceptional one . ' killed : last night ali was described as a ` martyr ' after he was reported killed by the pakistan 's inter-services intelligence , or isi , which has carried out a number of counter-terrorism operations in the region of his work as a doctor choudary adds : ` tariq 's skill as an nhs surgeon working at the royal free hospital amongst others was also something which he used for the benefit of others outside of his work time . ` in once instance , instead of having me wait to be seen at the hospital to remove an infection in one of my fingers , tariq brought his medical tools with local anaesthetic and operated at the back of a cafe local to me . ' i was n't the only one to benefit from having such a skilled surgeon as a friend . '
an alabama woman charged in her granddaughter 's running death testified wednesday that she would ` rather die ' than hurt the little girl , and denied making her run as punishment . joyce hardin garrard took the witness stand to say she never intended any harm to 9-year-old savannah hardin . when defense attorney richard rhea asked if she would have done anything to hurt savannah or any other grandchildren , garrard replied , ` i 'd rather die first . ' the 49-year-old garrard said she and savannah had been in the yard picking up sticks and talking , taking frequent breaks to get a drink of water and to play . she said she was telling savannah the importance of not lying . took the stand : joyce garrard , 49 , took the stand in her own defense wednesday in her trial for allegedly killing her 10-year-old granddaughter savannah hardin by forcing her to run as punishment for lying about eating candy ' i was picking up sticks with her because i felt just as responsible for her lying as she was , ' garrard testified . prosecutors say garrard killed the girl three years ago by making her run as punishment for a lie about candy . ` it was ` more like a jog and not a run , ' garrard maintained . garrard said savannah was such an active child , the only way to hold her attention was to keep her moving . ` we was hooting and hollering , fussing back and forth , ' garrard said . garrard said they picked up sticks for about 40 minutes , but spent much of the day in the yard . she said savannah told her she had to go to the bathroom and they were racing into the house when the girl fell backward . garrard said that 's when she told savannah 's stepmother , jessica mae hardin , to call 911 . ` did you have some intent to hurt savannah ? ' ` not that day or any other day , ' garrard replied . victim : garrad allegedly forced her granddaughter , savannah hardin ( pictured left and right ) , 9 , to run to her death at her home in etowah county in 2012 after discovering she had lied about eating forbidden chocolates arrests : garrard ( pictured , left , in her police mugshot ) was charged in the fatal february 2012 incident alongside savannah 's stepmother , 27-year-old jessica mae hardin ( right ) one word on a 911 recording could help decide garrard 's fate . with 9-year-old savannah lying unconscious following an afternoon of running and a 911 operator listening over the phone , joyce hardin garrard asked for something -- either a cigarette or a blanket . the request , depending on exactly what she said , could be considered callousness or compassion . on the feb. 17 , 2012 , recording , played in court tuesday , garrard is heard in the background as the girl 's stepmother , jessica mae hardin , talked for more than 11 minutes with lori beth beggs , a 911 operator in etowah county . ` my daughter had a seizure , ' hardin says at the beginning . speaking in a loud voice as hardin talks to beggs , garrard is heard repeatedly saying the child 's name and asking her to wake up . savannah , ' garrard says in a steady voice . ` savannah , open your eyes . ' then , nearly three minutes into the recording , with savannah still unresponsive , garrard makes a request . ` give me a smoke , ' beggs testified the woman said . the defense maintains she said : ` give me a throw , ' referring to a small blanket . while jurors have listened to the recording , circuit judge billy ogletree refused to let them see a transcript of the audio prepared for the defense . what the jurors believe she said could be vital . if garrard asked for a cigarette while the girl lay before her dying , jurors could agree with prosecutors that the woman was angry and meant to kill the child by running her for hours . if they believe the woman said ` throw , ' jurors could see that as sign garrard was worried and trying to help the girl . other testimony showed that the girl was wrapped in a small blanket when firefighters and paramedics arrived . scene : gerrard allegedly made her granddaughter carry sticks of wood as she ran to her death at her home ( pictured ) . but defense lawyers are expected to argue that the third-grader 's death was n't gerrard 's fault prosecutors were preparing to cross-examine garrard later wednesday after she was questioned by her attorney . garrard faces a death sentence or life without parole if convicted of capital murder . the girl 's stepmother is awaiting trial on a murder charge in the girl 's death . authorities said she sat by without intervening while the older woman forced the girl to run until she dropped . a defense expert said in dramatic testimony tuesday that he would n't classify the death of a young girl as a homicide even though her grandmother is accused of running her to death , yet he agreed the child would n't have died without exhausting physical exertion . questioned by an attorney for garrard at her capital murder trial , forensic pathologist dr. james lauridson indicated he could n't say someone else caused the death of savannah hardin , 9 . ` knowing what i know i would not have called this a homicide , i would have called it indeterminate , ' said lauridson , retired chief medical examiner for alabama department of forensic sciences . lauridson also disagreed with autopsy findings that concluded the girl suffered from heat exhaustion and dehydration . lauridson -- using water , dye and a plastic skull to demonstrate sodium deficiency -- said the girl was actually over-hydrated and had no signs of heat illness . mother and daughter : savannah ( pictured with her mother in a facebook photo ) eventually collapsed and started seizing . she was rushed to a nearby hospital , where she later died from dehydration and low sodium jurors paid close attention to lauridson , standing and craning their necks to follow his testimony . garrard began crying after he said her granddaughter 's death was n't a homicide . but under cross-examination by prosecutor marcus reid , lauridson admitted he did n't have all the witness statements and police files that were available to dr. emily ward , the state pathologist who ruled that the girl 's death was a homicide . her decision was crucial to the decision to charge garrard . neighbors have testified they saw the 49-year-old boaz woman forcing the girl to keep running even after she was vomiting and begging to stop , and reid drove home the point to jurors . ` it was running that killed her . is n't that right ? ' ` yes , ' lauridson replied . lauridson 's testimony built upon that of former forensic investigator chris crow , who helped ward with the post-mortem investigation of savannah 's death . crow testified that a report indicated ward did n't have the girl 's medical records before conducting the autopsy . the final autopsy report was n't completed until weeks after garrard already had been indicted , he said . crow said the autopsy took ward only an hour , which he described as ` pretty quick ' for such an examination . but crow testified under cross-examination that ward was more experienced than other pathologists in her office , possibly accounting for her speed , and ward was in a meeting where authorities detailed their evidence . prosecutors are seeking the death penalty against garrard , who is accused of making the girl run for hours as punishment for a lie about candy on feb. 17 , 2012 . garrard , of boaz , says she is innocent . run to death : savannah ( pictured ) suffered from unspecified medical issues that resulted in frequent doctors visits , court documents state . defense attorneys have said it was her medical condition that caused her death
( cnn ) a federal judge has ordered the defense department to release photos that allegedly show detainees being abused in detention centers in iraq and afghanistan during the bush administration . the photos wo n't be made public right away . in an order issued friday , u.s. district judge alvin k. hellerstein of the southern district of new york granted the government 60 days to appeal . the aclu sued the defense department in 2003 to have the photos made public . it 's not clear how many photos are involved or where the pictures were taken , but in an august opinion hellerstein said the government acknowledged having at least 29 pictures from at least seven different locations in afghanistan and iraq and may have hundreds or thousands more . some of the photos may have come from the notorious abu ghraib prison in iraq . in 2004 , photos became public that showed american soldiers abusing abu ghraib detainees and putting them into humiliating sexual positions . people in the mideast and americans were outraged and shocked by the photos , which added to the national debate on the use of torture in the war on terror . hellerstein said the government failed to prove its argument that releasing the photos would endanger american soldiers or civilians overseas . in july 2011 , the judge blocked release of the photos at the urging of the secretary of defense because u.s. troops were still fighting in iraq . by december 2011 , most u.s. ground troops had withdrawn from iraq , the judge wrote , and he did n't know whether release of the photos would affect military operations . " three years is a long time in war , the news cycle and the international debate over how to respond to terrorism , " he wrote . the judge also said the government failed to convince him a collective review of the photos met the requirements of the protected national security documents act . the aclu argued the defense department must individually review each photo and explain why its release would put americans in danger . jameel jaffer , aclu deputy legal director , said in a statement that the photos are " the best evidence of what took place in the military 's detention centers , and their disclosure would help the public better understand the implications of some of the bush administration 's policies . " a response by the pentagon to the judge 's decision was not immediately available . the pentagon has refused to release the photos requested by the aclu , saying publication could endanger american soldiers and civilians overseas . several u.s. military leaders who saw some of the pictures made that argument in a december 19 filing in the lawsuit . they pointed to public demonstrations in mideast countries that followed reports of quran burnings , the release of the video " innocence of the muslims " and the 2012 release of a video that showed americans soldiers urinating on dead enemy combatants . navy rear adm. sinclair harris of the joint chiefs of staff said islamist extremist groups like isis use " imagery associated with united states detention practices " as part of their recruiting efforts . the aclu responded by saying the military leaders did n't see all the photos , just a sampling selected by an army lawyer . the aclu also said the leaders did n't explain how the photos were " similarly inflammatory . " their prediction of anti-american violence was only speculation , the aclu said . " to allow the government to suppress any image that might provoke someone , somewhere , to violence would be to give the government sweeping power to suppress evidence of its own agents ' misconduct , " jaffer of the aclu said .

do you have any idea how much sugar you 're eating ? it 's probably a lot more than you think . as this shocking graphic reveals , millions of us are unwittingly eating everyday foods packed with sugar - and getting fatter in the process . while some culprits , such as coca-cola and ice cream are well known ( and used here for comparison purposes ) , there are many other less obvious foods - such as pasta sauce , soup and so-called healthy granola - that are loaded with the white stuff . for example , a 500g jar of dolmio bolognaise sauce contains more than six cubes of sugar - the same as a mars bar . and heinz tomato soup is on par with bulmer 's cider in the sweetness stakes , with five cubes . danger : as this worrying graphic reveals , millions of us are unwittingly eating everyday foods packed with sugar - and getting fatter in the process even a ` healthy ' fruit such as a mango contains nine cubes . however the sugars in milk , vegetables and pieces of fruit ( as opposed to fruit juice ) , including dried fruit , do not wreak as much havoc . so if you 're getting most of your sugar from these sources , you can eat up to 18 cubes daily . more and more evidence suggests that too much sugar is contributing to the obesity and diabetes epidemic . it is the sheer quantity of sugar that we consume that creates the problem , says roy taylor , professor of medicine and metabolism at newcastle university . ` sugar calories slip down so easily and lead to weight gain . ' the world health organisation ( who ) recommends no more than 10 per cent of a person 's daily energy should come from free sugars - those that are added to processed foods and drinks , but also those found naturally in honey , syrups and fruit juices . that equates to around 50g or 10 cubes a day - easily reached with a bottle of fizzy drink . however , the un agency advises that people aim for no more than five per cent - 25g or around six teaspoons - to achieve the biggest health benefits . yet many of us are consuming way in excess of this . a report published by the the world health organisation earlier this month revealed the current average intake of free sugars in north and central america is 95g a day ( 19 cubes ) rising to 130g ( 26 cubes ) a day in south america . meanwhile in western europe the average is 101g ( 20 cubes ) . hidden health threat : a 500g jar of dolmio bolognaise sauce contains more than six cubes of sugar - the same as a mars bar . meanwhile heinz tomato soup is on par with bulmer 's cider , with five cubes . with the global obesity crisis spiralling out of control , health experts are becoming increasingly vocal about the dangers of ` hidden sugar ' in food . graham macgregor , professor of cardiovascular medicine at the wolfson institute of preventive medicine at barts and the london hospital , says the food industry is adding more and more sugar to food , which consumers are largely unaware of , as it is mostly hidden . he said : ` added sugar in our diet is a very recent phenomenon and only occurred when sugar , obtained from sugar cane , beet and corn , became very cheap to produce . ` it 's a completely unnecessary part of our calorie intake : it has no nutritional value , gives no feeling of fullness and is acknowledged to be a major factor in causing obesity and diabetes both in the uk and worldwide . ' the two most common forms of unhealthy added sugars are table sugar ( sucrose ) and high-fructose corn syrup , a liquid sweetener made from maize . both are added to countless foods , turning up in everything from fizzy drinks to chicken korma . sugars in fruit juices and honeys are also the unhealthy ` added ' type . ` added sugars are more likely to do harm as they are n't safely bound in the structure of a food , as they are in fruit , ' says sasha watkins , a spokesperson for the british dietetic association . ` it means they are available to the body in higher concentrations . ' he added : ` while it may not be surprising that a can of coca-cola has a staggering seven cubes of sugar ( 35g ) , similar amounts can be found in the most unlikely of foods . ' these include flavoured water , yogurts , canned soup , ready meals and even bread . professor macgregor also cautions against opting for low fat foods that are often full of sugar instead to give them flavour . ` you might opt for 0 per cent fat in your yoghurt , but what if it also comes with five teaspoons of sugar ? a bowl of frosties with semi-skimmed milk only has four . ' as tam fry , from the national obesity forum , says : ` stripping out fat from processed foods makes them less appealing to our taste buds . ` the inevitable consequence is that manufacturers increase other ingredients , including sugar , to recreate taste and texture . ' research also shows the huge toll sugar can take on our health . though we all need some sugar - it is the essential fuel that powers all cells in our body - excess levels have been linked with raised levels of the hormone insulin , which increases the risk of diabetes . furthermore , the body turns excess sugar into fat , which is stored around the major organs , placing us at risk of liver and heart disease . there are also fears that high sugar diets may promote some cancers . the theory is that glucose , one of the main ingredients in added sugar , creates repeated spikes of insulin . even a ` healthy ' fruit such as a mango contains nine cubes , while a muller light strawberry yogurt has 2.5 for reasons that are not clear , many tumours seem to have insulin receptors , hence a rise in this hormone fuels their growth . a large population study in the us showed that people who consumed more than 25 per cent of their daily calories from added sugar had almost three times the risk of dying from heart disease . that was compared with those people who consumed less than 10 per cent of their calories each day through sugar , independent of other risk factors including weight . professor macgregor believes the sugar in our diets should now be gradually reduced , just as salt has been over the past few years . ` salt content in food products in the supermarkets have now been reduced by 20-40 per cent and as a result , salt intake has fallen in the uk by 15 per cent ( between 2001-2011 ) , the lowest known figure of any developed country . ' ` like salt , most of the sugar we consume is hidden in processed food and soft drinks . ` there are also specific taste receptors for sugar , which if sugar intake is gradually reduced , become more sensitive . so over time we do n't notice that sugar levels have gone down .

a man rushed to hospital for a kidney transplant has spoken of the dilemma he faced after learning the donor organ could be infected with hiv . tony gartside had waited four years for a donor organ before he finally got the call to say a kidney and pancreas had become available . the transplant window was so small that after putting the phone down at 3am , he was rushed from his home in plymouth to oxford for the operation . but upon arriving , he was told that the organs had come from the victim of a drugs overdose - and it would be two weeks before tests revealed if they were hiv free . tony gartside , 40 , had waited four years for a donor organ before he finally got the call to say a kidney had become available . but he faced a dilemma after learning the donor organ could be infected with hiv mr gartside , 40 , was born with type 1 diabetes , and his kidneys began to fail by the time he was 32 . he said : ` they showed me into a room and told me the donor organs had come from a death by drug overdose and asked if i still wanted to go ahead . ` because the person died by drug overdose , they would n't know whether the donor had hiv for two weeks . ` it was a scary process having to say yes or no after sitting in the back of an ambulance for hours . ' i thought : " do i risk it and say yes , or do i say no and wait another 18 months , or even longer ? " ` in the end , i went ahead with it . ' the kidney transplant surgery took 10 hours and left mr gartside with 32 staples in his stomach . after the surgery , he was sick for days , unable to even stand up straight , and was concerned about the risk of hiv . two weeks later the hiv results came back - and were , to his relief , negative . he has since made a full recovery . mr gartside said : ` my diabetes has completely changed - it 's amazing - and even that does n't describe how good i feel . ` it 's a second chance and i will be forever grateful to the donor 's parents for making that decision . ' two weeks after the kidney transplant , the hiv results came back - and were negative he has now set up a support group for transplant patients - the mayflower support group - which supports patients going through the transplant procedure . he explained : ` doctors have the clinical experience and can tell you what 's going to happen during surgery , but they do n't have a realistic explanation of what is going to happen for the patient . ` it 's good to have someone to talk to who has been through what they 're about to go through . ` the transplant has made me feel like i really want to give something back . ' last year , two patients in wales died after being given kidney transplants infected with a parasitic worm . darren hughes , 42 , and robert ` jim ' stuart , 67 , were each given a kidney from a transplant donor who was carrying the deadly worm in his organs when he died . doctors were not aware the donor had the worm - known as halicephalobus , which lives in soil and is found in horses - when the transplant operations were carried out at the university hospital of wales in cardiff . mr stuart and mr hughes began to ` deteriorate rapidly ' after their surgery and died less than three weeks later . the two men are part of only five cases ever recorded across the world - and all have died from the worm infection . mr stuart , of cardiff , and mr hughes , of bridgend , had kidney transplants in november 2013 but both died before christmas . a post-mortem examination revealed they both died from infection called meningeoencephaltis which was caused by the parasitic worm .

' the suspect , dynel lane , 34 , was arrested presenting the abducted child as her own in hospital , and is facing charges of first-degree attempted murder , assault and child abuse . she been remanded in boulder county jail on $ 2 million bail . dynel catrece lane , 34 , ( pictured with her husband , david ridley ) was facing murder charges in colorado after she allegedly cut a baby from the womb of a seven months ' pregnant woman who she lured to her home with a craigslist ad for baby clothes lane , who has two daughters , was held on $ 2million bail during a hearing at boulder county jail , colorado on thursday ( pictured in booking photo ) on friday , a member of staff at longmont united hospital today told daily mail online how wilkins did not realize she had lost her baby to a maniac and still believed she was carrying her child . abby johnson , 18 , an intern at the hospital said the horrified woman , who had blood pouring from her stomach , pleaded for help and was concerned about the safety of the baby which had been due this spring . johnson , speaking through her friend gary brennan , said michelle was in ' a terrible state with her guts hanging out . she had been bleeding really badly . ' her cousin told abc11 that the baby was her first and would have been her parents ' first grandchild . wilkins ' partner dan - the couple are not married and his surname is not known - is at her bedside . ` michelle 's always been a person who is kind hearted , a free spirit , has a love for all mankind , and i ca n't imagine what she 's going through at this time , ' tony wilkins , her cousin , told abc11.com . ` it 's almost like a horror movie . who would think that something like this would actually occur in real life .

' murder charges against lane now depend on whether the child was alive outside of the 26-year-old expectant mother 's womb , the district attorney 's office said on thursday . boulder county district attorney stanley l. garnett said : ` the issue of whether or not murder charges are appropriate involving a case involving the death of a fetus or a late-term pregnancy is always a difficult issue . protests : naomi garcia , 11 , left to right , her grandmother eileen egger , and jennifer ansell demand murder charges be brought against lane at an impromptu protest in longmont last wednesday ` under colorado law , essentially , there 's no way murder charges can be brought if it 's not established that the fetus lived as a child outside the body of the mother for some period of time .

' lane allegedly lured wilkins to her longmont home on wednesday using the craigslist ad . wilkins arrived at the home shortly before midday . a knife with a 3-inch blade was found at the scene , according to cnn . lane , who has two teenage daughters , made a brief appearance in court thursday . a police report on thursday read : ` the person who did the incision would have to have researched the subject of cesarean births to achieve the level of accuracy .

' ` this will move the country through to the next major step in the process of nationhood . ` the prime minister said he found it awkward to have to stand up to pledge allegiance to her majesty the queen . ' if the queen is replaced as head of state , the island nation will retain links with the british crown through its membership of the commonwealth . however , downing street has said it was not aware of the decision , which was announced by mr stuart last night . a spokesman for prime minister david cameron said : ' i expect the approach will be consistent with self determination , decisions around this being a matter for the people involved . the queen and the duke of edinburgh on their last visit to barbados in 1989 , when they flew to the island on concorde meanwhile a spokesman for buckingham palace told mailonline it was a matter for the government and the people of barbados the queen last visited barbados 26 years ago in 1989 for the 350th anniversary of the barbados parliament . prince harry took a three-day trip there in 2010 when he played in a polo match for his charity sentebale . the earl and countess of wessex were the last british royals to visit the nation , in february and march last year . the eastern caribbean nation became independent from britain in 1966 but kept the queen as its official head of state . the queen is represented on the island by the largely ceremonial role of the governor general . a map showing the east caribbean island of barbados , which gained full independence in 1966 after being a british colony plans to make barbados a republic have been on the horizon for a number of years . in 2005 , the then prime minister owen arthur outlined his proposals for dropping the queen in favour of a locally elected president , but the process was not completed . the same year , barbados made the caribbean court of justice its final court of appeal , rather than the london-based privy council , which has long served as the highest court of appeal for many ex-british colonies . in 2012 , jamaican prime minister portia simpson miller also pledged to replace the queen as head of state . barbados was colonised by james i in 1625 after the first english ship under the command of captain john powell docked there . wealthy english men were then allocated land in barbados with many of the trees cut down to make way for cotton , sugar and tobacco plantations . slaves in barbados dance and march through the streets after slavery was abolished in 1834 . many slaves were taken to the caribbean island in the 1700s to work on the land barbados formerly dominated the sugar industry . pictured are sugar cane plantation field workers in 1910 the island then went on to dominate the sugar industry and became the final destination for slaves , who were rounded up from west africa . after slavery was abolished in 1834 , many people were drawn to the country in due to its warm climate and slow pace of life . the island gained internal autonomy from britain in 1961 and full independence in 1966 , but remains a member of the commonwealth . the queen is sovereign of 15 commonwealth realms , in addition to the uk , including the bahamas , barbados , belize , jamaica , canada , australia and new zealand after barbados , pictured , abolished slavery , many people were drawn to the country due to its warm climate and slow pace of life celebrities such as simon cowell , left with partner lauren silverman , and wayne and colleen rooney , right are frequent visitors to barbados today the island is a hugely popular tourist destination attracting around half-a-million visitors each year . it is also the destination of choice for celebrities such as simon cowell who holidays every year at the island 's exclusive sandy lane resort . other celebrities spotted in barbados include rihanna , who is originally from the island as well as david and victoria beckham and wayne and colleen rooney .

home secretary theresa may , pictured in downing street today , insisted the net migration target was ` important ' , even though latest data shows the figure hit 300,000 last year the conservatives are to repeat a pledge to cut net migration to the tens of thousands , despite utterly failing to meet it during the last five years . home secretary theresa may insisted the target was ` important ' , even though latest data shows the figure hit 300,000 last year - three times what david cameron promised . the net migration target is now set to be included in the tory manifesto for may 's general election , after mrs may and mr cameron rejected repeated warnings that it was a mistake . a total of 298,000 more people arrived in britain than left in the year to september , as the numbers arriving from the rest of the eu hit a record high . before the last election mr cameron pledged to cut the figure below 100,000 , a promise he repeated in 2011 : ` no ifs . a record 624,000 arrived in britain in a year , up from 530,000 in the previous 12 months . at the same time , 327,000 left , a figure which has barely changed since 2010 . senior tories including william hague last week tried to claim the failure to meet the target was a ` problem of success ' because workers from struggling european economies were flocking to booming britain . but calls have grown for the tories to ditch the pledge , because the government is unable to control the numbers arriving from the eu . senior figures , including chancellor george osborne , health secretary jeremy hunt and communities secretary eric pickles are understood to have voiced doubts about the idea . former home secretary ken clarke said globalisation had made the immigration target impossible to meet , while baroness warsi , an ex-tory party chairwoman , said it was ` unrealistic ' . now mrs may has signalled that she intends to include a pledge on net migration in the conservative manifesto . ' i think we will keep the target , ' she told the times . ` it is important because it is about not just dealing with those coming into the system but also about making sure that those people who should n't live here actually leave . ' she added : ` you will have to wait for the manifesto to see the exact words . the idea of the net migration target will still be there . ' net long-term migration to the uk was estimated to be 298,000 in the year ending september 2014 , a major rise on the 210,000 figure a year earlier net migration from the eu hit 162,000 in the year ending september 2014 , up from 130,000 in the previous year ` we would like to see net immigration in the tens of thousands rather than the hundreds of thousands . ' ` levels of immigration can return to where they were in the 1980s and 90s . net migration to this country will be in the order of tens of thousands each year . that 's a promise we made to the british people . ' ` when we made that comment ... we were very clear that was what we wanted to do . it remains the objective towards which the prime minister and others are working . ' ` it is , of course , unlikely that we are going to reach the tens of thousands by the end of the parliament . ' she also sought to put pressure on other cabinet ministers , with a warning that the impact of immigration is felt across whitehall . mrs may said : ` obviously the home office is responsible for uk visas and immigration , the border force and immigration enforcement but actually immigration is an issue that touches across government departments and has a whole number of different aspects . ` it affects issues around jobs , questions of illegal working , access to housing , education , the nhs . ` it touches all government departments and i think that 's the thing that 's important . ' downing street blames the increase on the number of people moving from within the eu , which the government can not control . ministers have argued that immigration from outside the eu has been falling as a result of tighter border restrictions . however , non-eu net migration is at its highest level since the end of december 2011 . mrs may revealed she faced a battle with officials to get them to accept that immigration could cause problems . ` there was a problem with the orthodoxy in whitehall when we came into government in 2010 , ' she said . ` it was the idea that immigration by definition was good - in that automatically if you 've got more people , gdp goes up . ` of course , gdp per head does n't necessarily go up - so they did n't look beyond that point . ' prime minister david cameron promised before the election to cut net immigration in the tens of thousands former home secretary ken clarke said globalisation had made the immigration target impossible to meet , while baroness warsi , an ex-tory party chairwoman , said it was ` unrealistic ' downing street insisted mr cameron 's ` ambition ' to reduce net migration below 100,000 remained . mr cameron 's official spokesman told a regular westminster media briefing : ` you wo n't be surprised to know that he takes a different view from ken on this one . it wo n't be the first time that he and ken have n't had exactly the same views . ' the spokesman said the prime minister 's views on the need to reduce annual net migration below 100,000 had not changed since a speech in november , when he said that it remained an ` ambition ' , even if it was not possible to achieve it during this parliament . when the latest figures were released last week , deputy prime minister nick clegg today said the tories must now ` quite rightly suffer the embarrassment ' of breaking the promise . sunder katwala , director of the british future think tank , said : ` if the prime minister remains in denial about the broken target , he is setting himself up for five more years of failure . it is already clear there is next to no chance of meeting the same target in the next parliament either . ` it 's absurd to think that anyone would believe this broken promise if it 's made again . ` there is a simple political moral to this tale : careless promises cost trust . '

a couple have been left devastated after they spent ` every penny ' on a dream home which they found covered in animal urine and faeces on the day they moved in . marie louise campbell , 45 , was looking forward to moving into the house after viewing it on november 17 last year and putting in a # 145,000 offer which was accepted the following day . but when she and her fiance david alonzi , 46 , received the keys and tried to move in last month , they were shocked at what they found . marie campbell and her fiance david alonzi pictured with faeces and urine-covered debris in their new home animal waste can be seen smeared on the wall ( left ) while wooden panels ( right ) are noticeably stained the carpet was so wet with animal urine it had to soaked through to the joists , ms campbell claimed when they entered the property ms campbell said she was hit with a smell so strong it could ` knock you out ' she claims she was hit with a foul pong that could ` knock you out ' when she picked up the keys and unlocked the front door . faeces were splattered up the walls and urine covered the floors to the point that the carpets and floorboards needed to be removed . horrified ms campbell and her fiance , david alonzi , 46 , believe the property in crossgates , dunfermline , fife , was used as a dog run in the months following their viewing and accepted offer . ms campbell said : ` when we got the brochure and viewed ( the house ) , it looked fantastic , beautifully presented . it ticked all the boxes of what david and i were looking for . ' after there were delays finalising some of the contract details - known in scotland as the missives - she received the keys on january 22 , just over 10 weeks after viewing the property . ` when we got the keys we could not believe what was in front of us . we opened the front door and it was cat p *** i could smell . ' i have never seen anything like it in my life . there were yellow marks at the door entrance . i went to have a smell and it nearly knocked me out . ` there are poo and pee stains on the terracotta carpet . it was absolutely saturated wet with pee . we still have all the evidence locked in the garage . ` the carpet was wet . it went through to the underlay which was like a baby 's nappy . ms campbell and her fiance david alonzi believe the property in dunfermline , fife , was used as a dog run in the weeks before they moved in floorboards and carpet had to be pulled up as the couple tried their best to rid themselves of the smell ` we lifted the carpet up and the actual floorboard itself was wet . we then realised how extreme this was as urine had soaked all the way through to the joists . ` we could n't understand how bad the hallway smelled until we cut two feet of plaster from the floor up in the hall . ' she believes the former owner of the house , a prison officer , was leaving her animals unattended in the property during 12-hours shifts . she spoke to neighbours who said the two dogs - believed to be boxers - and three cats did not get out very often . the former owner allegedly told her that the property was ' a wee bit dodgy ' but that she would make it ` immaculate ' for them to move in . richard peters , a house surveyor working for allied surveyors scotland , said he checked the property on october 21 last year . ms campbell points out where animal waste was left smeared against a wall marie campbell and david alonzi pictured outside the home they purchased - which they are say they can not even live in this picture , taken of the home as it was advertised in the estate agents ' brochure , show it in perfect living condition prior to the sale the living room looked modern , clean and tidy , prior to its alleged use as a dog run the kitchen was also orderly prior to the damage caused by what was suspected to be animal waste pictured is the back section of the property , where building materials and animal-waste covered debris now lies he said : ` it was n't like that when i saw it . i would say at the time that there was no evidence of squelching underfoot or evidence of these horrible substances in accessible areas when i saw the house . ' the couple have spent their life savings and say they can not afford to live or fix the property properly - which they estimate would cost at least # 10,000 . the couple have now been forced to rent a flat for # 500 each month , as they can not move into the ` health hazard ' . scottish property law differs to that in the rest of the uk . once a formal written offer has been accepted in writing , both parties are bound to the transaction by contract . failure by one party to adhere to this written agreement , known as the ` missives ' procedure , can mean they must pay the other party a hefty compensation fee . a sale contract is commonly known as ` concluded missives ' - with the missives being the correspondence which completes the transaction . across the rest of the uk , either party can withdraw from the transaction up until the point when a contract is officially signed . ms campbell said : ' i feel helpless because i ca n't do a thing . ' i just ca n't see myself ever settling in there after everything we 've gone through with all the deception and lies we 've been told . ` we are really struggling to do anything about this . we are currently renting a flat costing us # 500 a month . ` we can not move into this house in that condition , it 's an absolute health hazard . ` even after scrubbing the house for two weeks with enzyme cleaner and bleach , we could n't get rid of the terrible smell . ' adrian king , of selling agent remax , dunfermline branch , added : ` the house was marketed by office and viewed and inspected by the purchaser who then preceded to purchase the property . ` any deterioration in the property which may have occurred in the intervening period between the inspection and purchase , is a matter to be resolved between the respective purchasers , vendors and solicitors . ' kate mcquillan , understood to be the former owner , was not available for comment . her solicitors sent a letter to the solicitors of marie louise campbell and david alonzi , which states : ` with regards to the carpets and floorboard , [ ms quillian ] is very upset at the allegation the dogs had been urinating through the whole house . ` she offered to touch bits up in the kitchen where the dogs slept and your client told her not to bother . ` our client will not be meeting the cost of replacement floorboards . the caveat emptor applies .

sebastian vettel laughed off nico rosberg 's claim that he hopes ferrari can catch mercedes during a spiky press conference after sunday 's australian grand prix . lewis hamilton , who romped to victory at the season-opening race in melbourne , and team-mate rosberg , finished more than half-a-minute clear of vettel to seal an utterly dominant weekend for the world champions . after the race , rosberg said he hoped ferrari would be able to bring the challenge to mercedes , with he and hamilton expected to dominate this term having won 16 of the 19 races in 2014 . lewis hamilton was caught in the middle as nico rosberg ( left ) and sebastian vettel traded jibes hamilton ca n't keep a straight face as vettel laughs off claims he hopes ferrari catch mercedes this season but his suggestion provoked a spiky response from vettel , the four-time world champion who celebrated his ferrari debut with a podium finish . ` be honest , do you really hope so ? ' quizzed vettel when rosberg claimed ` it would be good if they [ ferrari ] can come a bit closer ' . vettel added : ` seriously ? you finished 30 seconds ahead of us and you hope it 's going to be closer ? so you hope you slow down ? is that what you 're saying ? ' rosberg responded : ` i hope that you can give us a challenge . because it 's important for the sport and for the fans . and i do think about the show . i want to give people a great time at home watching on tv or at the track . if you do come a bit closer , that would be awesome for everybody . ' vettel points to the crowd as he celebrates his first ferrari podium on his debut for the famous italian team the four-time world champion finished the best part of 30 seconds behind hamilton and rosberg on sunday former red bull driver vettel then called on his german compatriot to give him a guided tour of the mercedes garage at the next race in malaysia . ` you can come if you want , we can invite you , ' said rosberg . ` ok , thank you for the invite , i 'll come , ' vettel replied . the spat continued when vettel said it was ` a shame ' that his team-mate kimi raikkonen did n't finish the race -- the finn was forced to retire after his pit-crew failed to properly attach his rear-left tyre during his second stop . ` you find it a shame that your team-mate did n't finish ? ' quizzed rosberg , seemingly still irked by vettel 's earlier interrogation . i do n't know how much you like each other , ' answered vettel in reference to rosberg 's relationship with hamilton , which descended into chaos at times last season as they vied for the title . ` but kimi and myself we get along , so i think it is a shame , ' vettel added . hamilton saw off the challenge from rosberg to win the opening race of the new season video hamilton cruises to victory in australian gp q : question to both lewis and nico . we 've seen dominance in qualifying , dominance in the race today . is this it for the season ? a two-horse race between you two for the title or can you envisage any of your rivals making in-roads into your supremacy ? lh : i think nico was just explaining ... i did n't know , i did n't see the times or anything but i think the ferraris have taken a huge step forward . it 's clear they 've made one of the biggest steps . so we definitely can not back off because i 'm sure they 're going to be pushing . and i anticipate we might have a good fight with them at some stage this year ... nr : i hope we can have a good fight . i think the next couple of races we 're going to be leading the way for sure , and we 're going to try and keep it that way , but we know it would be good if they can come a bit closer , as long as they do n't come too close ... do you really hope so ? you finished 30 seconds ahead of us and you hope it 's going to be closer ? so you hope you slow down ? is that what you 're saying ? nr : i hope that you can give us a challenge ! because it 's important for the sport and for the fans . and i do think about the show . half of me -- or a part of me -- thinks about the show because i want to give people a great time at home watching on tv or at the track . if you do come a bit closer , that would be awesome for everybody . sv : first suggestion , if you do n't mind , i think your garage becomes public for malaysia and everyone can have a look . nr : you can come if you want , we can invite you ... sv : ok , thank you for the invite , i 'll come . nr : friday malaysia , ok . sv : engineers ' room ? debrief , i 'll be there . q : sebastian , among the races to come , which one do you feel will be the one that is easier for you , for ferrari to catch up to the mercedes ? i think malaysia will be difficult but what about bahrain or shanghai ? sv : easy , for us ? i think if you look at the gap , nowhere is going to be easy . i think we have to focus on ourselves , make sure that what we learned this weekend we 're able to take into the next races . the most important thing now is that if we finish -- we did finish right behind mercedes today . we need to confirm that in the next race , that 's the priority number one , so we need to make sure that i was not just a one-off . as i said , kimi did n't finish , which is a shame . we could have scored a lot more points today . nr : ... that you find it a shame that your teammate did n't finish ? i do n't know how much you like each other but kimi and myself we get along , so i think it is a shame . nr : i though as a racing driver you might like it that you have a couple of points advantage over him now . i do n't want to get you off the foot there , sorry . look at him , look at him go ... sv : i can see your point . i can see that at the moment , where we are , we want to make sure we catch you guys and to do that we both need to score . yes , i honestly think so and i honestly did n't want to see the second car not finishing today . nr : because i 'm ready for it now , you caught me a bit off guard before but now i 'm ready for it ! teen sensation max verstappen missed out on finishing in the points in his grand prix bow . verstappen , 17 , the youngest driver in f1 history , was running in ninth before mechanical gremlins struck . he was forced to park his toro rosso after 32 laps , which , in a remarkable coincidence , was the same number his father jos completed before retiring on his 1994 f1 debut in brazil . lewis hamilton 's win , the 34th of his gp career , means he has won seven of the last eight races . it leaves him five shy of vettel , fourth on the all-time list , and seven adrift of boyhood hero ayrton senna . it is understood that susie wolff , the british racer , will not deputise for valtteri bottas in malaysia if the finn fails to recover from his back problem . ` susie is our test driver , not our reserve driver , ' said the team 's boss claire williams .

paranoid : benjamin pettitt attacked dr robert davis so viciously in may 2012 that paramedics were initially unable to tell if he was still alive - because there was so much blood a patient turned into ` little less than an animal ' by a cocktail of drugs beat a doctor with a baseball bat before trying to gauge out his eyes after his worried grandmother called for medical help . benjamin pettitt beat dr robert davis so badly after he attended his home in tewkesbury , gloucester , that police called to the scene were unable to see if the doctor was still alive , because he was covered in so much blood . the 33-year-old began attacking the doctor with a baseball bat , before the frenzied assault escalated and pettitt began trying to ` bite chunks ' out of his victim 's face . pettittt then grabbed a knife to inflict numerous lacerations , as his horrified relatives called paramedics and police - who were forced to taser pettitt . dr davis survived , but the vicious attack has forced him to quit the medical profession because he was left unable to trust patients . gloucester crown court heard how , in the days leading up to the may 2012 attack , pettitt had taken heroin and cocaine . pettitt became paranoid , convinced a number of french men wanted to kill him . on the morning of the attack , he is understood to have taken an heavy cocktail of prescribed anti-depressants . his grandmother had grown concerned with his paranoia as pettitt was convinced that a number of french men wanted to kill him . the morning of the attack he is also understood to have taken an heavy cocktail of prescribed anti-depressants . his grandmother had become so concerned she had called for a doctor - and it was dr davis who attended . prosecuting , anna vigars said : ` after about 15 minutes of rational conversation it suddenly turned . ` pettitt shouted , " bastards like you are only in it for yourselves " . ` he took a baseball bat and started to swing it at dr davis , he hit his arms , his shoulders and his nose . he hit him a number of times , including one very painful blow to his head . ` then mr pettitt was on top of him , trying to gouge his eyes out . mr davis was trying to take hold of his arms . call for help : the medic had been called to the house in cotteswold road , tewkesbury , gloucester , after pettitt 's grandmother became concerned about his increasing parnoia . ` as his hands were moved away , ( pettitt ) leaned forward and tried to bite mr davis ' face - he tried to bite a chunk from his nose . ` he then began shouting , he shouted : ' i really want to kill you , it would be a huge adrenaline rush ' . in terror mr davis was crying which he was mocked for by mr pettitt . ` mr pettitt then managed to get hold of knife . that caused the top part of his thumb to be sliced . ` thereafter he described how he was punched a number of times , but when ambulance staff arrived it became clear they were actually stab wounds to his left shoulder and the left side of his head . ` at that stage they did n't know whether or not mr davis was alive simply because of the amount of blood . ` in a police interview he told officers it had felt like a dream and he had woken up remorseful for what had happened . ' the doctor , who had been practising for 27 years , was left with a number of lacerations to his head , thumb and shoulder , as well as a fractured nose and bruising . the damage to his thumb was so bad , he required plastic surgery . but it was the mental scars dr davis was left with which have refused to heal . mental scars : dr davis has since quit medicine , saying his is unable to trust patients anymore in a victim impact statement read in court , dr davis revealed : ` by july this year ( 2013 ) i have very little left in the was of physical injuries - i do consider myself very lucky . ` but mentally the affect this has had on me has been far harder to come to terms with . ` in the first four weeks i was bursting into tears very often and my emotions were up and down . ' i found myself waking in the middle of the night thinking about what had happened - i struggled to sleep . ` it seemed incomprehensible that this could happened to me . ' i feel no malice towards him . i feel more anger to the nhs for putting me in the situation where my safety was at risk . ` due to this attack i feel no desire towards returning to work . i 'm not sure i could sit there and try to help patients again in case i am in a similar situation . ` overall this has had a huge impact on my life . this is probably a career ending event for me . ` the memory of this ordeal will stay with me for a very long time . ' psychiatric expert dr tim amos told the court that pettitt suffered from a number of drug induced mental health problems . brendan moorhouse , defending , said his client had ` expressed genuine remorse ' for the attack . he added : ` he understands the consequences to the doctor and he lives with the results of his actions every day . ' judge jamie tabor qc ordered that he was hospitalised under section 45 of the mental health act . he also imposed a minimum prison sentence of nine years , meaning if pettitt is released from hospital within that time frame he must serve the remainder of the nine years in prison . on sentence the judge told him : ` this cocktail of drugs turned you into quite frankly little less than an animal - causing you to shout out you wanted to kill that man and that you would get an adrenaline rush from it . ` you would n't recognise that man if you saw him .

bafetimbi gomis ' collapse had those inside white hart lane holding their collective breath , with players , officials and fans fearing the worst after the swansea striker 's episode . as play was about to resume following a fine , early nacer chadli volley , hush fell upon the ground where three years ago bolton midfielder fabrice muamba suffered a cardiac arrest . there was a deathly silence as paramedics and medical staff tended to gomis , who left the white hart lane pitch on a stretcher and wearing an oxygen mask after several minutes of treatment . bafetimbi gomis lies face down on the pitch after collapsing during swansea 's game with tottenham medical staff attended to the france international for four minutes before he regained consciousness concerned tottenham players look on as the swansea forward is attended to my medical staff fortunately , good news soon emanated from the swansea dressing room and , later in the evening , gomis himself said he was ` feeling well ' after fainting . it was the latest episode stemming from a long-standing fainting condition and one which left brad friedel , on the bench three years ago and watching from the stands on wednesday , worried a similar incident to muamba 's was unfolding . ` it went through everyone 's mind , ' the veteran american said . ` anyone who was at that game probably thought the worst immediately . ` it 's not normal for someone to be standing there and collapse and you know it 's going to be something serious . ` but after a minute or so the word got back , so that 's why you did n't see the panic on the players ' faces because everyone knew he was all right . ` it was something that had to be dealt with , of course , but it was nothing in the stratosphere of what went on with fabrice . ' gomis , who has a history of blacking out , is taken off the field on a stretcher at white hart lane tottenham midfielder nabil bentalib ( right ) holds his head in his hands as gomis is taken off on a stretcher friedel 's comments were echoed by spurs winger andros townsend . ` it kind of brought your memory back to fabrice muamba , ' he said . ` it did n't look good . ` when ( muamba collapsed ) i was n't here . i was on loan at birmingham but seeing what happened with gomis could have meant going down the same route . ` thankfully he 's okay , hopefully he can make a speedy recovery . ' as worrying as the incident was , play continued and soon after ki sung-yueng drew parity for swansea . players from both sides appear shocked as referee michael oliver prepares to restart the game on 17 march 2012 , fabrice muamba collapsed on the pitch at white hart lane during an fa cup quarter-final match between bolton and tottenham . the former trotters midfielder suffered a cardiac arrest and received life-saving medical treatment from spurs staff and consultant cardiologist dr andrew deaner , who was at the game as a fan , from the pitch . muamba was rushed to the nearby london chest hospital , accompanied by then manager owen coyle and striker kevin phillips , for emergency treatment while the game was abandoned . medical staff rush to fabrice muamba 's aid after the midfielder suffered a cardiac arrest in 2012 muamba 's heart was reported to have stopped for 78minutes while the former birmingham player received numerous defibrillator shocks on the pitch and in the ambulance . despite fears that he would not survive , the 26-year-old made a miraculous recovery before being discharged from hospital on april 16 - although he was forced to retire from professional football . ryan mason and townsend netted in the second half to give spurs a lead gylfi sigurdsson chipped away at late on , yet mauricio pochettino 's side ran out 3-2 victors . it was an important result following their europa league and capital one cup disappointments , especially as defeat on wednesday would have seriously dented their top-four ambitions . ` it was the perfect response , ' townsend said in a week they have lost big games against fiorentina and chelsea . ` to lose a cup final and have to play a very good side three days later is always difficult , but we knew we had to go out there tonight and start fast right from the off . ` we knew we had to get the crowd on our side and lift the doom and gloom from the weekend , and i think we did that . ` we got the early goal and it set us on our way to a great win . ' ryan mason wheels away in celebration after scoring against swansea on wednesday evening the result denied swansea a third straight premier league win , although midfielder jack cork does not think the performance or result was impacted by the gomis incident . ' i was obviously worried , ' he told press association sport . ` when something like that happens , you 're obviously worried , but the medical staff say he is fine so hopefully it 's not too bad . ` the guys said ` do n't worry about it , just keep your minds on the game , he is okay ' blah , blah , blah . ` ash ( williams ) was just reassuring us saying do n't worry about it and we had to carry on like it had n't happened . ` in the first half we did okay , we played some okay stuff but the second half was tough for us . ` they overloaded certain areas and made space on the wings for the full-backs . ` it was tough for us but we had to try and keep a good shape and a couple of mistakes cost us the game .

swansea manager garry monk believes the only way is up for tim sherwood as the two coaching course mates prepare to cross tactical swords at villa park . monk and new aston villa boss sherwood got to know each other on the same football association of wales pro-licence coaching course but the practical takes precedence over the theory on saturday with three barclays premier league points at stake . sherwood got his break in management at tottenham first - a position he was unlucky to lose according to monk - and the former england midfielder has revived villa 's fortunes with three successive wins taking them away from the premier league danger zone and into the semi-final of the fa cup . aston villa manager tim sherwood is preparing for the visit of former coaching coursemate garry monk sherwood has enjoyed a great start to life since taking over the villa park managerial hot-seat ` he 's gone in there and lifted the confidence in the group , ' monk said at his pre-match press conference . ` you need results to do that but they 've got very good players there who obviously were n't playing to their full potential before tim took over . ` but he 's had an instant impact . he 's a very honest guy , black and white , and that comes across in his interviews and the way he approaches the game . garry monk believes himself and sherwood are very much their own men despite their similarities ` they 're fighting for their lives and we know this game is vitally important to them but it is the same for us . ` we 've got our own agenda , we want to achieve our best total of 47 points , and i think you 've seen our attitude and focus in our recent games against tottenham and liverpool . ` the actual performances deserved more than they got and we need to make sure we replicate that to get the points at villa . ' the pair have both been labelled with the tag of bright , young british managers , even if the 46-year-old sherwood is actually 10 years older than monk who celebrated his first anniversary as swansea boss last month . swansea manager monk observes his players during the training session at the fairwood training centre but monk says while certain similarities exist between them they are very much their own men with notable differences . ` when tim came in at spurs he was already within the club at that time , albeit within a different coaching role , ' monk said . ' i came from a playing background into it and i would n't say we were similar managers with the same approach or anything like that . ` but we 've got the same desire , commitment and principles and are clear in what we want . ` i 'm on the same coaching course as tim and his views on football are very interesting . monk believes the former tottenham hotspur boss will certainly take aston villa forward in the future ` he 's had a fantastic start and i am sure he will take aston villa forward after being unlucky at tottenham . ` he has been given his chance and taken the opportunity really well , he has got them going . ' swansea are seeking to recover from back-to-back league defeats and will come across a former favourite at villa park in the shape of scott sinclair . the 25-year-old 's career nose-dived after his # 6.2 million move from swansea to manchester city in august 2012 , sinclair starting only two league games at the etihad stadium before joining villa on loan in january . scott sinclair will come up against his former swansea teammates during the game at villa park but sinclair has thrived under sherwood with three goals in five games and monk admits it is satisfying to see his former teammate doing well after such a difficult time in his career . ` scotty has been searching for regular football and it is good to see him playing , ' monk said . ` he did tremendously well for us and we will never forget what he did here . ` it is no surprise to see him playing regular football in the premier league because he 's got the talent to do that . ' sinclair has thrived since arriving at aston villa following an unproductive spell with manchester city

nbc nightly news anchor brian williams had pitched to nbc and cbs about making him the next late-night show host before he was busted for falsifying stories . williams , 55 , is currently suspended from nbc without pay as a team investigates claims he lied in reports about the iraq war and hurricane katrina , among others . but prior to the suspension he had agreed to a five-year anchor deal with nightly news after being persuaded into it with a gift of veteran broadcaster edward r murrow 's old desk . brian williams agreed to a five-year contract after being persuaded by nbc news president deborah turness , who gifted him with veteran broadcaster edward r murrow 's old writing desk and few years ago , williams told nbc universal ceo steve burke that he wanted to take over the tonight show from jay leno . burke turned down williams 's idea and instead offered him a weekly program called rock center , which williams hoped could evolve into a variety show . instead , the show ended up mirroring 60 minutes and it was canceled after two seasons , according to new york magazine . williams pushed on , however , and went to cbs ceo les moonves to suggest succeeding david letterman . moonves was n't interested , sources told new york magazine . williams then had to be convinced through lengthy negotiations to become a news anchor by nbc news president deborah turness . though they first clashed - because williams was used to having the final say over a show 's content - the pair eventually warmed to one another . brian williams suggested succeeding both jay leno ( left ) and david letterman ( right ) . ceos from nbc and cbs turned down his offers williams sent turness a note over the holidays that read , ' 2015 is going to be our year together ' , according to new york magazine . he went on to agree to a new five-year anchor deal , during the same dinner turness presented him with murrow 's old writing desk . she had found the 1940s desk through a los angeles-based antique dealer . and less than two months later , williams was publicly shamed for a backlog of fictional stories and executives struggled with how to deal with the situation . this comes just after speculations that katie couric might be is in talks nbc 's incoming chairman andrew lack to make a return by replacing williams on the nightly news . ` it makes sense ( that she could come back ) because she is so closely associated with the brand , ' a source told the new york daily news . lack ` has not made up his mind ' as to whether or not williams will return when his six-month suspension is up , according to new york magazine 's sources . a ` close friend ' of williams said the the magazine , however , that the anchor ` ca n't wait until he can speak ' , which he ca n't do publicly until his suspension ends .
a washington d.c. tech entrepreneur has recalled his anger at learning his former playmate wife had died in a hot tub after a night of sex , cocaine and drinking with her lover . gary hensley , 37 , detailed the heart-wrenching moment he found out his wife cassandra had died and the challenges he has faced as a single father to her two children from a previous relationship . ` i 'll always miss her , ' hensley told the washington post . cassandra lynn hensley , who was named a playboy playmate of the month in 2006 , had flown from the couple 's home to los angeles to attend playboy 's 60th anniversary party in january 2014 . family : gary hensley is widowed and a single dad to his step-children , alexis and devin , pictured , following the death of his wife , former playboy playmate cassandra lynn , in january 2014 but after taking part in a photo shoot , the 34-year-old headed to a photographer 's apartment , had sex with him and binged on drugs and alcohol , tmz previously reported . in the early hours of the next morning , the photographer woke up and found cassandra unconscious in the bathtub . emergency responders were unable to resuscitate her and she was pronounced dead . gary hensley , who met cassandra when they were neighbors in 2007 , was home with her two children , alexis and devin , then 12 and six , when an acquaintance messaged him asking : ` is it true ? ' moments later , two police officers turned up on his doorstep and explained that his wife had been found dead in los angeles - although they would not reveal the circumstances . ' i just had this overwhelming sense of wanting to be next to her , ' he told the washington post 's ellen mccarthy . questions : hensley is pictured with his wife , who was found dead in a hot tub after a night of sex , drugs and alcohol with her lover in los angeles . he said he is still haunted by questions of how much she loved him playmate : cassandra , pictured with hugh hefner , had been named a playmate of the month in 2006 but after calling the coroner , he learned the lurid details of her death . he said his reaction was anger - because he did n't know how he was going to raise the children without her . ' i was so angry at her , ' he said . ' i was like , " what am i going to do ? how am i going to raise the kids ? how do i get alexis through prom and her wedding and all those things you 're not going to be there for ? " ' today hensley , who has since learned that the affair had been going on for a while , is still haunted by questions of how much his wife loved him . ' a year past all that , i just have come to the resolve that for the five years we were together , she did - to the degree that she could , ' he told the post . ` and nobody 's perfect . he knew cassandra had struggled with drugs and alcohol when she was younger and , in the months before her death , he noticed that she had started drinking again . hensley , who launched a tech start-up that was later acquired by pearson education , said his job 's uncertainty , problems in her own career and their move to washington d.c. , where cassandra was judged for her past , had been tough on her . struggles : he said that before her death , cassandra ( pictured in 2007 ) had struggled with problems in her career and in their new life in washington d.c. , where she was not accepted because of her past cassandra , who worked as an event hostess before her death , started drinking again , including the night before she flew to california . they did n't talk that night , hensley said , but she texted him after heading to the airport to say that she loved him . after her death , he eventually returned to their home with the children , whom he had been raising as his own . their biological father had not wanted custody , the post reported . ` it was a very quiet , very lonely , very clean house , ' he said . ` nights were particularly hard . ' he took time from work and tried to bring some normalcy to the children 's lives , figuring out how to talk to them about the tragedy , and getting through the days with the help of family and friends . he said they 've now ` got it down ' and the children both call him ` dad ' . ` it always makes me smile , ' he said .
gareth bale is being linked with a move away from champions league winners real madrid as the former tottenham forward continues to face criticism from the club 's supporters . manchester united and chelsea have both been credited with having an interest in bringing the world 's most expensive player back to the premier league . sportsmail asked manchester united fan dave ford of 90min . com to give his thoughts about a possible switch to old trafford . gareth bale reacts with disappointment as barcelona players celebrate after the clasico on march 22 bale scored twice to help wales beat israel 3-0 in a euro 2016 qualifier on saturday given the opportunity , there 's not a club in the world who would n't want to sign gareth bale and manchester united are no different . the welshman is the future of football . united are showing signs of life again . we 've picked up our form under louis van gaal , sit in the premier league 's top four and beat liverpool at anfield prior to the international break . big money was spent last summer and it will be this year too . it 's all systems go in terms of firing us back to the top of english and european football . however , while the attack is starting to click into gear , something is still missing . most of us have confidence that angel di maria will come good , but we still want more . bale is what we want . having two former real madrid stars in tandem at old trafford is the stuff of dreams . sure , we 'd love to have cristiano ronaldo back too , but our former no 7 has just turned 30 and dare we say it - his best days may be behind him . a 25-year-old bale is the man to pin the hopes on . bale 's celebration was cut short as he had a goal disallowed for offside against barcelona bale argues with barcelona forward neymar jnr as real lost 2-1 to the la liga leaders it 's not all plain sailing for the boy from cardiff in spain . he has been criticised in the madrid press for not pulling his weight , he went missing in last weekend 's clasico and his car even got a boot up the backside from a supporter in the fallout . real madrid fans are historically fickle and bale is their latest scapegoat . rest assured that it 'll be his head on the chopping block next time real lose a game . he does n't deserve to be treated like some children 's toy - picked up when loved and thrown down to the ground when not . bale should seek a club where his talents are appreciated . manchester united are prepared to offer an escape route and the subsequent affection he needs . unfortunately , bale is still a big part of florentino perez 's plans and the player himself feels like he still has so much to prove . united are not an option that bale wants to take just now , but the offer will always remain on the table . bale has been criticised by fans this season and even had his car attacked by angry supporters the former tottenham forward leads the celebrations after scoring his second and wales ' third of the match his potential signing is not a case of need . after all , no club is going to spend # 86m on a player if he is n't considered some kind of luxury . bale is a player that can lead us to our former glory . you 'd only have to look at the effect he had on tottenham before leaving for spain for proof of his influence . however much he 'd cost , bale would be a worthwhile investment . his ability to play on either flank or through the middle make him a great option , given he can fit around the likes of angel di maria , juan mata and wayne rooney in whatever system suits . heck , he could even play alongside marouane fellaini . any move might unfairly consign the excellent ashley young back to bench-warmer , but football has a habit of not being fair . nevertheless , do n't expect the move to happen this summer . bale has a lot left to prove in spain and he 's too proud a person to walk away from his dream club just yet . but if there 's ever a return to the premier league on the cards for gareth bale , we will be waiting with open arms . for more fan views or to join the conversation visit www.90min.com .
a sky tv reporter has revealed he was ` devastated ' by the suicide of a woman who killed herself days after he exposed her as one of the twitter trolls who abused the mccann family . brenda leyland , 63 , from burton overy , leicestersire , died in october days after being approached on camera by martin brunt . the reporter confronted her on the subject of hundreds of posts she had written about the mccann family , whose daughter madeleine went missing in portugal in 2007 . at an inquest into her death today mr brunt said he was ` devastated ' when told she had been found dead days later . brenda leyland died days after being exposed by sky news journalist martin brunt as one of the twitter users posting negative messages about the mccann family ' i was devastated , i still am and the enormity of what 's happened will always be with me . ' he approached the woman on september 30 last year after being given a list of the names of people who had been trolling the family . among some 400 posts written by mrs leyland , she described kate and gerry mccann as the ` worst of humankind ' . after tracking the divorcee down to the village in leicestershire , mr brunt and his camera crew approached her outside her house . introducing himself as a sky news reporter , he asked her why she had been using twitter to ` attack ' the family . mrs leyland responded : ` i 'm entitled to do that , ' before saying that a scotland yard investigation into the tweets was ` fair enough ' . she died days later after checking in to a hotel in nearby enderby . today mr brunt said he was surprised she had engaged with him at all in the days beforehand . ' i was rather surprised that she did speak to me and did engage with me , ' he said . following their filmed exchange mrs leyland got in to a parked car and drove away . later she returned to the house and invited the reporter inside . ` after she left , we stayed in the village and i did a piece to camera . we were just packing up to go when she returned , ' mr brunt added . the 63-year-old was approached by a sky news team over her use of twitter to write messages about the mccann family ` we approached her again as she walked up to her house and she said " come in martin " . i went in and spoke to her for about half an hour . ` once in the house she seemed very relaxed . i said i had caught her on the hop and asked if she would be willing to do an interview in her house , but she was n't interested . ' i said i hoped i had n't ruined her day , and she said i had n't ruined her day - but her life . ' he added the woman was ` at pains ' to explain why she had written the negative messages about the mccann family . ` she said she had concerns about the fundraising and was concerned they had left madeleine with her siblings alone . ` she said , " i have questions for the mccanns " . ` she said she thought twitter was a means to express opinions and hoped she had not done anything unlawful . ' mr brunt added he explained the police were in discussions with the crown prosecution service . ` she acknowledged she was ( the twitter user ) " sweepyface " and said " i probably wo n't ever tweet again " ' . the following day mrs leyland contacted mr brunt on the phone number he had given her during their visit and asked whether she would be identified in the broadcast . ' i did say i would keep her informed because i am aware of the impact such a confrontation can have on somebody , ' he told the inquest . the pair spoke again the night before the clip was shown . asked whether he could detect any concern for her life during their conversation , mr brunt said : ` no , but when i asked her how she was , she said " oh i have thought about ending it all but i am feeling better - i have had a drink and spoken to my son . ' he added he thought her comments were a throwaway remark and that he had no knowledge of her battle with depression at the time . the inquest heard how mrs leyland had previously grappled with mental illness and had tried to take her own life once before . in a statement her son ben , who lives in america , said the encounter had left his mother ` panicked ' . ` on september 30 she called me and it was clear to me from her tone of voice that she was panicking , ' it read . ` she said " i have been tweeting about the mccanns , i have had a reporter from sky news here and a report has gone to scotland yard " ' . ` we discussed what action to take to avoid her name and picture appearing in the media . mrs leyland had posted more than 400 tweets about kate and gerry mccann ( above ) whose daughter madeleine went missing in portugal in 2007 ` on october 2 , i was aware the story had broken . i tried to contact my mother without success , i discussed with my dad and brothers going round to check she was ok . ' i got an email from mum on wednesday saying she felt " cheerier " . ` my mum has always struggled with depression and has undergone therapy and psychiatric treatment . ' i have been thinking a lot and have no doubt of the panic and fear in her voice , and think the sky news report was the final straw . ' recording a verdict of suicide , senior leicester coroner catherine mason described mrs leyland as an ` intelligent and loving person ' . ` she was aware she had come into the public eye . i have heard all guidelines were followed by sky and brenda invited mr brunt into her property . ` she was also kept informed of how the story would be run . i am satisfied that although brenda leyland did have a medical health history , others would n't necessarily have known she was suffering . ` although she did mention wanting to take her own life , she then dismissed it . ' ` she was upset by her public exposure in the media . she planned ( her death ) independently and had insight into her actions , so i therefore conclude a verdict of suicide . ' the cause of her death was given as asphyxiation due to gas inhalation . a former psychiatric consultant of mrs leyland , dr kajetan zakrewski , said the risk of self-harm had ` always ' existed due to her state of mental health . following the coroner 's verdict sky news issued a statement expressing its condolences . ` the team at sky news followed its editorial guidelines and pursued a story in a responsible manner that we believed was firmly in the public interest , ' it read . ` brenda leyland 's tragic death highlights the unforeseeable human impact that the stories we pursue can have , and sky news would like to extend its sincere condolences to her family .

an anguished daughter has begged her father to reveal where he hid her murdered mother 's body , three decades after he carried out the horrific crime . after 30 years of silence , 71-year-old russell causley has finally opened up about the murder of veronica packman , who disappeared from her family home in bournemouth in june 1985 . for 11 years , causley had concocted a false story about his wife 's whereabouts . but , after being investigated by police for a separate insurance scam , causley was convicted of her murder in 1996 , despite ms packman 's body never being found . a daughter is urging her father russell causley , 71 ( left ) to reveal where he has hidden the body of her murdered mother veronica packman ( right ) now samantha gillingham , 46 , is begging for her depraved father to reveal the whereabouts of her mother 's body , as the 30th anniversary of her disappearance approaches . the former aircraft engineer had suggested meeting with the family so he could finally reveal what had happened - but he cancelled the confrontation , just days before it was due to go ahead . mrs gillingham said : ` it is my father who approached us to speak , we responded to listen to what he has to say , only for him to cancel four days before . ' i am asking for help ; i need to ask once again if there is anything that someone knows , who has not previously come forward for whatever reason - please rethink on your silence . ' ms packman , 40 , and causley - both wealthy , middle-class aircraft engineers - had been having several marital problems when she went missing . mrs gillingham , then 16 , later discovered a scrawled note from her mother saying she had left and wanted no further contact with the family . it came 12 months after causley had moved his mistress patricia - a colleague - into the family ; s ipswich road home , under the pretence that she needed somewhere to stay . following ms packman 's disappearance , causley changed his name by deed poll from packman to causley , the surname of his lover . samantha gillingham ( left ) , who was 16 when her mother ( right ) disappeared , said she needs to know where her mother 's body is so she can gain closure on the horrific incident the family lived a respectable , middle-class life in bournemouth , dorset , until causley ( centre ) moved his mistress patricia into the family home , 12 months before ms packman ( left ) disappeared he then created a cover story about ms packman 's disappearance , to convince friends and family she was still alive . mrs gillingham believed her mother had abandoned the family . but 11 years later , causley was jailed for two years after he tried to fake his own death in a boating accident in a million-pound insurance scam . ms causley was also handed a 12-month suspended sentence for conspiring to defraud . but , more importantly , the investigation led detectives to reopen the case into ms packman 's disappearance . causley was then charged with her murder before being convicted in 1996 at winchester crown court . it was one of the first uk cases where a murder conviction was secured without a body being found . causley 's conviction was quashed on appeal in 2003 but he was found guilty again at a retrial the following year . he then concoted an elaborate story about where ms packman had gone , to convince friends and family she was still alive . pictured : ms packman ( left ) , causley ( centre ) and mrs gillingham as a child ( right ) while in prison , causley confessed to three inmates that he had killed his wife . he is also said to have told one that he gassed her before dissolving her body in acid . he then made further admissions in august last year , at which time mrs gillingham and her family were given hope that he would tell them everything , in exchange for being moved to a lower-category prison . but six months later , that promise has still come to nothing . mrs gillingham added : ` for the first time i am asking if there is anyone with legal or forensic ability who would be able to offer their professional services or who would be able to finance such services . ' i feel acutely embarrassed to ask for something where i am unable to pay . i need to find my mother . my mother did not deserve this . ' mrs gillingham ( pictured with her father during a family holiday in the 80s ) wants those with legal or forensic skills to be able to help in the search meanwhile , mrs gillingham 's 26-year-old son neil called his grandfather ` scum ' and said he continues to ` rip the family apart with his malicious poison ' . he said : ` he has n't engaged , he continues to take the same arrogant , obnoxious stance and although he admits his guilt i feel this is a ploy to gain early release without giving closure . ` he continues to rip our family apart with his malicious poison . my grandfather is a dangerous man , this has now been confirmed . ' i want answers fast , i need support and i want to ask for support from those who can make a change . ' he added : ' i want to appeal for anyone with forensic experience to assist me in finding the missing pieces in that jigsaw - those with technical knowledge , lawyers , politicians , anyone who may have known something - to come forward . mrs gillingham 's son neil , 26 , ( right ) said his grandfather was ` scum ' and has ` ripped the family apart ' ' i am determined to make a change , this is unacceptable that a convicted murderer can continue to torment and systematically destroy my family with such disregard from behind prison doors . ` he is scum and we should be supported to ensure that we put a stop on this from continuing . he should die behind bars . ' detective inspector mark samuel from dorset police said : ' i ca n't begin to imagine the frustration felt by the family . since the parole hearing we 've re-interviewed causley in prison and revisited the address at ipswich road and we 're grateful for the co-operation of the current owners and neighbours . ' i would like to emphasise how determined we are to find closure and get to the truth in this matter . ` only one person holds the key to this , russell causley holds all of the information and we too appeal to him to invite us to come and speak to him . ` there are powers in place that allow us to meet with him , but it needs his willingness to physically talk . ' causley is at hmp littlehey in cambridgeshire and is due to face the parole board again this summer .
( cnn ) a grand jury in clark county , nevada , has indicted a 19-year-old man accused of fatally shooting his neighbor in front of her house last month . erich nowsch jr. faces charges of murder with a deadly weapon , attempted murder and firing a gun from within a car . police say nowsch shot tammy meyers , 44 , in front of her home after the car he was riding in followed her home february 12 . nowsch 's attorney , conrad claus , has said his client will argue self-defense . the meyers family told police that tammy meyers was giving her daughter a driving lesson when there was a confrontation with the driver of another car . tammy meyers drove home and sent her inside to get her brother , brandon , who allegedly brought a 9mm handgun . tammy meyers and her son then went back out , police said . they encountered the other car again , and there was gunfire , police said . investigators found casings from six .45 - caliber rounds at that scene . nowsch 's lawyer said after his client 's first court appearance that brandon meyers pointed a gun before anyone started shooting . he said the family 's story about a road-rage incident and what reportedly followed do n't add up . after zipping away from the first shooting , tammy meyers drove home and the other car , a silver audi , went there also . police said nowsch shot at both tammy and brandon meyers . tammy meyers was hit in the head and died two days later at a hospital . brandon meyers , who police said returned fire at the home , was not injured . the driver of the silver audi has yet to be found by authorities . that suspect was n't named in thursday 's indictment . nowsch was arrested five days after the killing in his family 's house , just one block away from the meyers ' home . he is due in court tuesday for a preliminary hearing .
( cnn ) in 1971 , a physicist conceptualized the existence of a fourth fundamental element in the electronic circuit , besides the three that were already in use at the time . his name was leon chua and he believed -- for reasons of symmetry -- that an extra component could one day be constructed to join the resistor , the capacitor and the inductor . he called it " memristor " , a portmanteau of the words memory and resistor . it took 37 years for our engineering abilities to catch up with that idea : the first memristor was built by hewlett packard in 2008 . and today , many researchers believe it could spark a revolution in computing . simply put , the memristor could mean the end of electronics as we know it and the beginning of a new era called " ionics " . the transistor , developed in 1947 , is the main component of computer chips . it functions using a flow of electrons , whereas the memristor couples the electrons with ions , or electrically charged atoms . in a transistor , once the flow of electrons is interrupted by , say , cutting the power , all information is lost . but a memristor can remember the amount of charge that was flowing through it , and much like a memory stick it will retain the data even when the power is turned off . this can pave the way for computers that will instantly turn on and off like a light bulb and never lose data : the ram , or memory , will no longer be erased when the machine is turned off , without the need to save anything to hard drives as with current technology . but memristors have another fundamental difference compared with transistors : they can escape the boundaries of binary code . initially , the technology will be mostly used to create super-fast memory chips that contain more data and consume less energy . this alone would make regular computers much more powerful , but down the line , the memristor could also take on the processing . jennifer rupp is a professor of electrochemical materials at eth zurich , and she 's working with ibm to build a memristor-based machine . memristors , she points out , function in a way that is similar to a human brain : " unlike a transistor , which is based on binary codes , a memristor can have multi-levels . you could have several states , let 's say zero , one half , one quarter , one third , and so on , and that gives us a very powerful new perspective on how our computers may develop in the future , " she told cnn 's nick glass . such a shift in computing methodology would allow us to create " smart " computers that operate in a way reminiscent of the synapses in our brains . free from the limitations of the 0s and 1s , these more powerful computers would be able to learn and make decisions , ultimately getting us one step closer to creating human-like artificial intelligence . transistors are based on silicon , a rigid material whose properties are used to manage the flow of electrons , and thus information . in 1975 , gordon moore , the co-founder of intel , formulated a famous law which states that the number of transistors in an electronic circuit doubles approximately every two years . this has so far proven accurate and set the pace for the constant increase in computing power , but the trend might soon come to an end . there is a physical limit to the number of transistors that we can pack on a chip , and we are already approaching the miniaturization threshold of this technology . it is inevitable that , one day , we will need to move away from silicon based computing . the memristor technology is a candidate for this crucial step : " it could mean the end of the silicon era , giving us lower power consumption , the ability to compute more information , increased data storage and completely new logic patterns for our computers , " says rupp . memristors do n't require a silicon layer and different materials can be used as a substrate . this could create a new class of microchips , that could eventually be integrated in everyday items such as windows , clothes or even coffee cups . after manufacturing the first ever memristor , hewlett packard has been working for years on a new type of computer based on the technology . according to plans , it will launch by 2020 . simply called " the machine " , it uses " electrons for processing , photons for communication , and ions for storage . " " i think there is a race going on , " says rupp . " there is a strong driving force , but at the same time it 's very important that there are players like hp , because they want to get to the market , show everyone that this is real . " at the moment , manufacturing costs are still high , but the benefits are worth it : " memristors operate at a lower power consumption , with a faster speed , and with a higher volume density of information than anything we have based on silicon microchip transistors , " rupp told cnn . much like a particle in the realm of physics , the existence of the memristor was theorized long before we could actually build one . now that we have that capability to manufacture it , the " missing fourth element " of electronics -- despite its less than catchy name -- might be the key to many further human discoveries . read more from make , create , innovate : behold the ` internet of sheep ' will you soon be able to ` swallow the doctor ' ? meet the world 's first 1,000 mph car
shocking footage has emerged of a driver who was found asleep in his car on a sydney motorway in the middle of the night . a motorist sent the video to ray hadley of 2gb radio , clearly unimpressed by what he has just come across . he filmed the male driver who appeared to be having a snooze in the driver 's seat while the car remained stationary on one of australia 's busiest freeways . shocking footage has emerged of a driver who was found asleep in his car on a sydney motorway in the middle of the night the footage was uploaded on youtube on monday , detailing the driver had ` passed out on the m1 motorway north of sydney ' the footage was uploaded on youtube yesterday , detailing the driver had ` passed out on the m1 motorway north of sydney ' . the man 's efforts to try and wake up the passed out driver were to no avail . ` yo buddy , wake up ! , ' he yells at the driver . another driver stopped and tried to waken the man but to no avail the man says the driver stopped in the left-hand lane as he approaches the vehicle with his camera . asleep , high beams on , no hazard lights ... dude 's asleep , ' the man said . ` dead set ca n't wake him up .

lululemon is hoping to boost sales among men with a new genital-friendly range of pants . lululemon athletica inc told bloomberg on thursday that its abc pants - referring to their ` anti-ball crushing ' design - have given the company a 16 per cent sales hike in the men 's sector of the business last quarter . the canada-based company 's website describes the pants as ` abc ( anti-ball crushing ) engineering gives you and the family jewels room to breathe ' . lululemon athletica were hoping their men 's abc pants - referring to their ` anti-ball crushing ' design - would boost sales the men 's pants were described by the company as ` giving you and the family jewels room to breathe ' the site goes on : ' a wide paneled gusset and four-way stretch warpstreme fabric make these pants commute , travel and sweat ready . ' the vancouver-based company made its mark on the sports retail market with yoga clothing consumers were divided over the abcs . one man wrote : ` despite the waist , the fabric is amazing however the legs were so tight and the fabric so thin . if i wore these out everyone would know what underwear i have on by being able to see the lines , that 's how tight the thighs are .

a six-year-old albino boy had his hand hacked off in a savage attack by a gang who use body parts for witchcraft . baraka cosmas was sleeping at his mother 's house in kipenda , tanzania , on saturday night when a group of men stormed in and grabbed him , police said . they beat up his mother before using machetes to cut off the boy 's right hand . a six-year-old albino boy had his hand hacked off in tanzania in a savage attack by a gang who use body parts for witchcraft the latest assault comes days after tanzania 's president jakaya kikwete blasted the wave of killings and attacks against albinos as a ` disgusting and big embarrassment for the nation ' . he said : ' i believe that with close co-operation between the government and society , we will succeed in ending these killings of persons with albinism and rid our nation of this shame . ' a police spokesman said : ` the gangsters got hold of the victim 's mother , prisca shaaban , and beat her severely after she refused to hand over the boy . tanzanian president jakaya kikwete ( above ) blasted the wave of killings and attacks against albinos as a ` disgusting and big embarrassment for the nation ' ` the assailants later used machetes to cut off the boy 's right palm and walked out . ' albino body parts are thought to sell for around $ 600 ( # 397 ) with an entire corpse fetching nearly $ 75,000 ( # 49,685 ) , a un expert said . at least 75 albinos have died in the region since 2000 . earlier in the week four people were sentenced to death for the murder of 22-year-old albino woman zawadi mangidu . tanzanian police on monday banned a planned demonstration by the tanzania albinism society in the country 's commercial capital , dar es salaam , citing security reasons . but kikwete has said he had agreed to meet albino leaders next week to discuss possible solutions to the killings . the murders have been concentrated in the gold-rich regions and fishing communities surrounding the country 's lake victoria , where superstitious beliefs are rampant . albinism is a hereditary genetic condition which causes a total absence of pigmentation in the skin , hair and eyes . it affects one tanzanian in 1,400 often as a result of inbreeding , experts said . in the west , it affects just one person in 20,000 . albinos are seen as curses , or ` ghosts ' who can be wiped off the face of the earth in many parts of tanzania . families are often told to kill the children at birth . yet , conversely , their body parts are highly prized . witch doctors claim albino body parts are capable of bringing riches , power and success , if used in potions , while a un report report into the trade revealed miners used the bone as amulets , or would bury them where they are drilling for gold . fishermen are said to weave the hair into their nets to help them catch more fish . children are particularly vulnerable - their innocence is highly valued and they are not as strong as the adults attacking them . most of the time , limbs are taken but a recent report noted that there have been cases where victims were beheaded , or had their genitals , ears , and bits of skin removed . tongues can also be cut out or the eyes and the heart gouged out . other types of attacks reported include rape for healing purposes . possibly , most shockingly , some believe the louder the screams while the limb is removed , the more potent the charm .

independent economists such as soumaya keynes ( pictured ) have urged both the tories and labour to be more straightforward about spending plans independent economists have urged both the tories and labour to be more straightforward with voters about their post-election tax and spending plans . researchers from the institute for fiscal studies ( ifs ) said that george osborne should spell out exactly how he plans to cut welfare spending by # 12billion . they also said that labour 's ideas to deal with britain 's deficit were ` less explicit ' than the other main parties , and could see ed miliband rack up tens of billions a year in borrowing . yesterday ifs director paul johnson criticised both the major parties over their lack of clarity ahead of may 's general election . referring to the chancellor 's planned # 12billion in welfare cuts , he said : ` it is now almost two years since he announced his intention of cutting welfare spending by # 12billion . it 's time we knew more about what that might actually involve . ' the chancellor signalled yesterday that a future conservative government would freeze benefits paid to people of working age for two years from 2016 . the freeze , which would not include pensions , disability benefits and maternity pay , would save # 3billion . last week the daily mail also revealed that other measures likely to be included in the tory manifesto include restricting child benefit to three children for new claimants , cutting the cap on welfare claims from # 26,000 to # 23,000 per household and removing the right of under-25s to housing benefit and jobless payouts if they refuse offers of work , training or education . researchers from the ifs said that george osborne should spell out exactly how he plans to cut welfare spending by # 12billion multi-billion pound plans to ` revolutionise ' travel in the north of england will be unveiled today . part of george osborne 's ` northern powerhouse ' strategy , they include new rail routes that could see 140mph trains reduce liverpool to manchester journey times to around 20 minutes . a so-called ` transnorth ' rail network would link liverpool , manchester , leeds , sheffield , newcastle and hull . the liverpool-manchester route could cost as much as # 13billion , while a plan to reduce journey times between sheffield and manchester from the 48 to 27 minutes could cost up to # 19billion . other plans include new east-west road connections and introducing oyster-style travel cards across the north . however even those measures would fall well short of the # 12billion mr osborne needs to find . yesterday ifs economist soumaya keynes also warned that labour 's rules were so loose that the party could end austerity next year and open the public spending tap again . she claimed that labour could increase real-term spending by more than # 9billion a year by 2020 , compared to tory plans to lower it by # 14billion by that point . labour has promised that it will balance day-to-day spending at some point during the next parliament , but has not yet specified when that will be . and unlike the conservatives , the party has not committed to balancing all government spending -- leaving it free to borrow tens of billions for ` investment ' . this means that under labour , britain 's # 1.5 trillion national debt could continue to grow indefinitely , while the tories would begin to pay it off by the end of the next parliament -- meeting david cameron 's pledge to ` fix the roof while the sun shines ' . yesterday the prime minister said it was clear that labour would borrow , spend and tax more than the conservatives . he added : ` i am determined not to go backwards . ' inheritance tax takings will double in the next four years at the current threshold , as middle-income families are dragged into paying the levy . forecasts from the office for budget responsibility revealed the taxman will rake in # 6.4 billion in 2019 -- up from # 3.4 billion in 2013 . once targeted at the wealthy , tens of thousands of ordinary families now pay the death tax following years of rapid house price growth . unchanged since 2009 , it is charged at 40 per cent of the value of any estate above # 325,000 , or # 650,000 for a couple with a joint estate . the figures come after it emerged the conservatives are considering raising the threshold in its election manifesto . george osborne 's tax boost for orchestras fell flat yesterday when mps claimed brass bands could be excluded . a consultation paper published in january suggested that to qualify , ensembles would have to include string , woodwind , brass and percussion sections . but labour said it would leave out brass bands popular in the north of england and swiftly branded the policy a ` trumpet tax ' . labour said george osborne 's tax boost for orchestras would exclude brass bands ( file picture ) shadow culture minister chris bryant said it would exclude string orchestras like the london sinfonia and accused george osborne of being ` out of tune ' . the treasury later insisted brass bands would be included , insisting the decision had been agreed weeks ago . it said the 25 per cent tax relief from next year will apply to any group of 12 or more musicians playing instruments in any of the four orchestral sections . interest rates could be slashed even closer to zero to keep britain 's economic recovery on track , a senior bank of england official suggested yesterday . chief economist andy haldane said rates may need to be cut again -- having been frozen at 0.5 per cent for more than six years -- if inflation threatened to stay too low for too long after it tumbled to 0.3 per cent -- its lowest level since 1960 . his intervention sent sterling tumbling on global currency markets and came days after bank governor mark carney said a cut would be ` extremely foolish ' . mr haldane said : ` the chances of a rate rise or cut are broadly evenly balanced .

the greek government has proposed hiring tourists to help uncover tax dodging businesses in holiday resorts as part of its efforts to rescue the country 's shattered finances . holidaymakers could be recruited alongside students and housewives to form an army of so-called ` onlookers ' carrying hidden cameras and recorders to catch tax dodgers . the plan , which met with immediate mockery from critics , emerged in a leaked letter sent by greek finance minister yanis varoufakis to the president of the eurogroup jeroen dijsselbloem , which outlines a range of reforms for the greek economy . revelation : the unusual plan emerged in a leaked letter sent by greek finance minister yanis varoufakis ( above ) to the president of the eurogroup jeroen dijsselbloem in the letter essex-university educated varoufakis said : ` the culture of tax avoidance runs deep within greek society . ' arguing that tax authorities were overstretched , he suggests hiring ` large numbers of non-professional inspectors ' to spread fear among tax-avoiders . the plan would involve basic training for the amateur tax sleuths who would be ` wired for sound and video . ' the inspectors , who would operate across the country with tourists most suitable for spying on resort areas , would not be able to confront tax dodgers or have any authority to carry out checks but the evidence they collected could be used in prosecutions . the inspectors would be hired for a maximum of two months and would not be re-hired . varoufakis , finance minister of the new left-wing syriza government in greece , claims the move would create a new climate in the country . secret filming : holiday makers could be recruited alongside students and housewives to form an army of so-called ` onlookers ' carrying hidden cameras ` the very news that thousands of casual ` onlookers ' are everywhere , bearing audio and video recording equipment on behalf of the tax authorities , has the capacity to shift attitudes very quickly spreading a sense of justice across society and engendering a new tax compliance culture , ' varoufakis writes in his letter . the idea however has met with derision from some quarters with one unnamed european official quoted as saying the plan was ` hilarious ' . the letter is the greek government 's detailed response to a request from its european partners to provide a list of reforms for its economy , a promise agreed by varoufakis last month in return for an extension of its current bail-out pending further talks . the tax spy proposal is one of seven reforms proposed by varoufakis , which will be considered by eurozone finance ministers on monday . other measures include taxing gambling , improving existing budget and tax collecting systems and creating a fiscal council which would act as an independent overseer of state spending . laws to create the fiscal council were passed by the previous greek government but have yet to be put into practice .
rob kearney has vowed that the ` real ireland ' will roar into murrayfield to try and salvage a six nations title win on saturday , amid continuing criticism of the performance in defeat to wales . ireland face a major challenge to retain the championship with england enjoying a better points difference and wales expected to run up a big total against italy in rome . however , the welsh were left fuming on monday night after it emerged there will be no trophy to present to sam warburton in the stadio olimpico even if it transpires after the final match of the day between england and france that the welsh are champions . rob kearney has vowed that the ` real ireland ' will try to salvage a six nations title win there are two six nations trophies and one will be in murrayfield , and the other in twickenham , a planning decision that has caused anger amongst some welsh supporters . it will require a more coherent and less error-addled performance from ireland to defeat the scots , and kearney did not shirk the challenge laid down before he and his team-mates . ` this week will be a big test and will give a really strong insight into the group as a whole , how we react after a very disappointing defeat , ' the full-back said . ` we 'll see the real ireland step up this week . a lot of us who underperformed last week know if we get the opportunity , [ we have ] to right a lot of those wrongs . ' ireland 's message for the week appears to have been decided : they will say they have no interest in chasing a big points total against winless scotland , but kearney did intimate that at least the desire for a more attacking style is there . the impression was of players straining , impatient for their coaches to let slip the leash . yet whether it is admitted or not , the sense in salting away as big a points difference as possible is evident given england 's superior figures and the fact that they are hosting underwhelming france . wales will also be confident of eating into the irish and english points ' advantage against italy . ` i think any time you get to the last game of a championship you can go and play a bit , ' said kearney on the question of style . ` when i say that , it 's important the wrong perception is n't picked up here and that we 're going to chase this game and we 're going to try and build points , because we 're not , ' he quickly added . video wales dash ireland 's grand slam hopes - highlights ireland will need a more coherent and less error-addled performance to defeat scotland ` but we do know that we have to go out and give this game a right bash . it 's important to get the win but how we do that will be no different to over the last three or four weeks . ' the ireland style council remain unmoved by criticisms of their game , and the claim in its aftermath that they were forced to work outside the strict instructions provided by schmidt in chasing the match last saturday . that explained the dislocated moves close to the wales line , goes this argument . ` we have good confidence in our running game , ' said kearney . ` we were just getting a lot of value from our kicking game . if you launch up a ball and it travels 40 metres and you get it back , that is the equivalent of a 40-yard line break which is very hard to come by . ` i think the other side of that is maybe we were chasing the game a bit from early so maybe we were forced to keep the ball in hand a little bit more and try and go after the game . ' they could n't do so , but there is little expectation of significant changes being made by schmidt for the trip to scotland . one of the rare positives to survive the journey to wales was the fitness of the squad . ireland were criticised for their poor performance in six nations defeat by wales no new casualties were sustained , and it is certain that the coach will stay largely faithful to the team that started in the millennium stadium . iain henderson was the most dynamic of the subs used against wales and is the most probable point of discussion in team selection this week , with a start in the second row rather than the back row a possibility . there have also been calls from some for the addition of luke fitzgerald to the replacements ' bench . kearney admitted that when a team is changed it can sharpen the attention of everyone within the group . ` it keeps everyone on their toes . i think every single player has been dropped at some stage in their career . it 's happened to the very best of guys . you 've got new guys coming into the team and they bring a huge amount of energy and excitement because they 're finally getting their chance . ` the guys who performed under par realise that maybe they have been given a second chance and they really need to pull their socks up . ` i think when that does happen there can be some positives taken from it .

liverpool midfielder joe allen believes he has come of age as wales prepare for what could be the defining moment of their euro 2016 campaign . allen does not grab too many headlines , with the likes of gareth bale and aaron ramsey for international company , but there 's no denying the effective role he plays in chris coleman 's side . the 25-year-old 's game is to break up attacks and get his team moving forward , and it is a role which has gradually won over reds fans after what he admits was a tricky start to anfield life following his # 15million transfer from swansea in 2012 . joe allen and gareth bale train on wednesday ahead of wales ' crucial qualifier against israel on friday allen faces the media ahead of chris coleman 's side clash against the group leaders ' i look back to my first season at liverpool and i was disappointed with the way i approached it at times , ' allen said . ` but the last couple of seasons i have certainly learned a lot and improved from that point of view and having those experiences . ' i understand now i have experienced a lot of highs in my career but unfortunately there are times when you will have some lows . ` my dip in form affected my confidence and it was the first time i had experienced that at club level . ` at swansea it had always been progress really so it was a bit of a setback , but i came through it . as well as holding down a regular place in the liverpool team in recent months , allen sees himself as a mainstay of a wales side which has started the european championship qualifiers so impressively . allen is enjoying a run in the liverpool side and has impressed during the club 's resurgence in recent months wales remain unbeaten after four games with an eight-point haul , but they face a serious examination of their qualification credentials against an israel side top of the group with an unblemished 100 per cent record , ' i have turned 25 now so i do n't consider myself a young player any more , ' allen said ahead of wales ' trip to what is expected to be a hostile sammy ofer stadium in haifa on saturday night . ' i have got enough experience both at club and international level to feel a big part of the squad . ` the experience i have had in the past will hold me in good stead going forward in international football . ' i am getting towards my peak and i hope to keep improving in the next few years and getting better . ' the wales midfielder admits that he found it difficult during his first season at liverpool wales have not been in such a promising position to end their long wait for a major tournament finals appearance since going close to earning a place at euro 2004 . on that occasion wales lost a play-off to russia and allen , then a 13-year-old schoolboy , admits the disappointment of that near-miss resonates with a lot of the current squad . ' i was at the russia game as my school used to go to the millennium stadium , ' allen said . ' i remember the disappointment of that night coming so close as do a lot of the lads . it is extra motivation for us . ` for youngsters and supporters to have experienced that we want to be the group to get there . ` we feel we are getting back to that level , we have quality and much more strength in depth than we have had in the past .

( cnn ) melissa was sold into the sex trade by a family member when she was only 12 years old . her life became a prison : chained to a bed in a warehouse , she endured regular beatings , rapes and once was even set on fire by her captors as she was forced to serve 5 to 30 men every day . the experience was enough for her to wish she was dead . and this all took place in texas -- right here , in our own country . melissa miraculously escaped her captors but , as is the case with so many other victims , she struggled for years to distance herself from her past , even finding herself in jail on multiple occasions . and while institutionalized slavery has long been cast from america 's history books , thousands of children still suffer from the bonds of sex trafficking . indeed , with the average age of a victim only 13 years old , these horrific crimes are stealing the innocent childhoods of kids across america . and the problem is n't confined to one part of the country . in , minnesota , for example , a 12-year-old girl received a text message that she thought was from a friend . it invited her to go to a party and asked her to go to a fast food restaurant nearby . but she did n't get to a party . instead , she was taken to a hotel and raped by a 34-year-old pimp , forced to take explicit photos of herself that were then posted on craigslist , before being forced to have sex with two more men who saw the post . these heartbreaking stories demonstrate what is broken about our current system , and why we both feel committed to fixing it . instead of treating people like these young girls as the victims they are , they are often thrown into the criminal justice system , labeled prostitutes and left with few options but to return to a nightmare that shockingly still exists in the united states . meanwhile , instead of treating their perpetrators as child rapists and traffickers , they are often simply treated as " johns " who , if caught , often pay a fine and go on their way . this is outrageous , and should not be tolerated any longer . that is why we 've joined forces with more than 200 advocacy groups to fight this modern-day slave trade and provide hope and opportunity for its victims . two bills we have introduced to combat this horrific crime recently passed the senate judiciary committee with strong support and will have the opportunity for consideration by the senate . the justice for victims of trafficking act ( jvta ) would support victims by taking fines and criminal assets from convicted human traffickers and directing them toward services and treatment to help victims restore their lives . the jvta does n't only help victims , it also arms law enforcement with more tools to go after human traffickers . it ensures these criminals , including " johns , " are brought to justice under our laws , because a financial transaction should not mask assault on a child . the second bill is modeled after minnesota 's " safe harbor " law , which helps make sure minors sold for sex are n't prosecuted as defendants , but are instead treated as victims . the stop exploitation through trafficking act ( sett ) would give incentives for all states to have a safe harbor provision . when a state passes a safe harbor law , it means that kids sold for sex are steered towards child protection services , rather than being arrested , charged , or convicted under a state 's criminal statutes . all across the country , from texas to minnesota , young people are being robbed of their innocence and subjected to unthinkable horrors and abuse . we must do everything we can to free them from the shackles of sex trafficking . we must join together and take action to combat this modern-day slavery once and for all .
there 's nothing more embarrassing than waking up at someone else 's place and having to step out in yesterday 's outfit . but now there 's a perfect solution to those morning after woes - a top that can be worn 24 different ways in a variety of colours , without the use of any zips , ties or buttons . the morf shirt is the brainchild of israeli-based designer tamara salem , who came up with the idea as a way of bringing a playful element to her wardrobe and getting more use out of key pieces . the morf top , which was invented by israeli-based designer tamara salem , can be worn 24 different ways thanks to a clever double-layered construction tamara told mailonline that her invention was ` almost accidental ' . ' i was making a shirt as a gift for my best friend 's birthday , and i had this vague idea for a multi-layer top with a black front and white back , ' she said . ` but only when i actually held it in my hands , i discovered i could flip it and get a totally black shirt , and then flip it again and get an all-white shirt . i realised then how many different options this structure offered , ' she explained . a mesmerizing video on the project 's kickstarter page , which has raised a whopping $ 35,600 so far , shows just how the shirt works with the clever use of double-layer construction . no more outfit repeats : the shirt , which comes in red , blue or green and costs $ 80 ( about # 52 ) , is billed as the perfect solution to a morning after situation the model in the video begins by wearing the top in plain black with a deep v-neck with grey panels on the sleeves . then she pulls it off inside-out and puts it back on , and this time it has black and white stripes in the front and plain black sleeves . when she rolls up the sleeves , they miraculously become a bright shade of blue . later , she turns the top inside-out yet again and it becomes grey with a neckline in black and monochrome stripes on the back . all in all , the top can be worn up to 24 different ways , providing almost an entire month of styles using just one piece of clothing . ' i believe that fashion is all about change , inviting us to re-invent ourselves , ' said tamara . ' i hope to get the attention of women who enjoy being unexpected and ever-changing . ' versatile : ' i believe that fashion is all about change , inviting us to re-invent ourselves , ' said tamara wear it everywhere : the morf is so versatile , it can be worn for all types of activities - from walking the dog to going to work and then transitioning to night tamara says the morf is so versatile , it can be worn for all types of activities - from walking the dog to going to work and going out on the town at night . ` for the price of a single shirt - you get an entire collection . and did i mention it is a packing and traveling miracle ? ' the morf top is currently the most popular fashion project on kickstarter , with 466 backers . it comes in both male and female sizes in red , blue or green , and will cost $ 80 ( about # 52 ) when it officially launches online on 29 april .

what is the last thing you remember about lionel messi and cristiano ronaldo ? for messi , it is most likely him tearing barclays premier league champions manchester city apart , making them look like a league one team lost in europe , nutmegging james milner to leave him with grass stains on his backside . for ronaldo , it may be him throwing his arm in the air in disdain , sulking back to the halfway line , protesting even though team-mate gareth bale had just put real madrid 1-0 up against levante . lionel messi may well be priceless as the barcelona star continues to find the best form of his career messi smiles during barcelona 's win over manchester city that knocked them out of the champions league cristiano ronaldo can not mask his frustration during real madrid 's last match against levante it was a tough night for ronaldo , who will need to improve fast for el clasico against messi 's barcelona it is an unforgiving game for the two undisputed best players on the planet . yet there is currently no debate to be had . the headlines this week belong to messi , even if he did n't break a champions league record on wednesday and his free-kicks served only to remind us he is human after all . there was more to his embarrassment of manchester city than missing out on his ninth goal in the tournament . if it was n't his menacing dribbles , it was his six shots against a magnificent joe hart . if it was n't his assist for ivan rakitic 's goal , it was his nutmeg on milner that reduced pep guardiola -- the architect of the barcelona way and current bayern munich manager -- to nothing more than another supporter in the stands . the one-twos , the drops of the shoulder , the shimmies . pep has seen it all before -- at the nou camp , at their ciutat esportiva joan gamper training ground , at almost every stadium he took barcelona to -- yet still it was enough for him to hide his face in disbelief . barcelona 's messi taunts the city defence on the edge of the penalty area during another classy performance messi joins in the celebrations after ivan rakitic 's opening goal with luis suarez ( right ) at the nou camp messi 's heat map showed he was very active in the city half . click here for more from our match zone service spanish paper mundo deportivo hailed the ` fantastic ' messi after his ` masterclass ' against manchester city that included ` nutmegs , dribbles and an assist ' , while he also featured on the front cover of sport should we have expected anything less ? messi has been untouchable this year . so much so it 's almost unfair , and part of the credit can even go to -- dare we say it ? -- his nemesis , ronaldo . it was on january 12 when the real madrid man got the better of the barca boy for the 2014 ballon d'or award , three weeks after ronaldo returned to his hometown of funchal on the island of madeira to unveil a statue of himself . before the ballon d'or ceremony , ronaldo beat messi in goals ( 33 to 25 ) , goals per game ( 1.18 to 1 ) , minutes per goal ( 70.94 to 87.24 ) , shots ( 119 to 96 ) , minutes-per-goal involvement ( 52.02 to 58.95 ) and they had 12 assists apiece in all competitions . messi sat there in zurich , to the left of ronaldo , and gritted his teeth afterwards as he congratulated the man that won with 37.66 per cent of the vote for his third ballon d'or . yet ronaldo 's cry of ` si ' lit something under the four-time winner . hell hath no fury like a messi scorned , and he is arguably playing better than when he was crowned the world 's best in 2009 , 2010 , 2011 and 2012 . since the ballon d'or ceremony , there 's been no contest . messi beats ronaldo on goals ( 18 to 8 ) , goals per game ( 1.2 to 0.73 ) , minutes per goal ( 75 to 122.75 ) , shots ( 60 to 52 ) , chances created ( 39 to 17 ) , assists ( 9 to 3 ) and minutes-per-goal involvement ( 50 to 89.27 ) . messi has been outstanding ever since ronaldo won the ballon d'or on january 12 and the stats prove it the frustration against levante was written all over ronaldo 's face as he leaned against the frame of the goal how the top of la liga stands ahead of el clasico to the overall statistics in all competitions this season , it puts messi ahead in the three major categories : goals ( 43 to 41 ) , assists ( 21 to 15 ) and , comfortably , chances created ( 112 to 68 ) . down to the brass tacks of la liga , too . there was a moment on november 22 , when ronaldo had 20 goals to messi 's seven . yet today , ronaldo has 30 to messi 's 32 . all this has reopened the debate between messi and his great rival that had a dissimilar experience in europe last tuesday . ronaldo is congratulated by fifa president sepp blatter during the ballon d'or ceremony in zurich ronaldo cry of ` si ' lit something under four-time winner messi , who has obliterated his form ever since ronaldo must up his game to stay in competition with messi if he is to retain the ballon d'or next year ronaldo , for a man that had broken the champions league goalscoring record , left the pitch shaking his head following a 4-3 defeat by schalke at the bernabeu . those all-too-familiar white handkerchiefs were waved in his team 's direction , and the spanish whistles were piercing . ' i wo n't talk again until the end of the season , ' ronaldo announced afterwards , as frustrated as any , while a poll by spanish newspaper as found 32.2 per cent voted for cristiano to be dropped . all is not right in ronaldo 's world , and he has been putting in additional work this week at the ciudad real madrid training ground in valdebebas . messi , meanwhile , warmed up for el clasico by putting on a masterclass for manchester city at the nou camp . ronaldo has been putting in extra work this week at the ciudad real madrid training ground in valdebebas ronaldo has been at the training ground preparing hard for the trip to barcelona 's nou camp on sunday guardiola was n't the only one mesmerised . just look at the feedback : the kid from next door in barcelona , with the ability to glue the ball to his foot , has been swaying a few votes in his favour , it seems . yet on sunday at 8pm , another chapter of messi vs ronaldo -- a rivalry that demands its own wikipedia page -- will be written in front of an estimated global television audience of 500 million . messi received plenty of feedback from the world of football and beyond for his performance against city messi delivered a man of the match performance as he ran the city defence ragged at the nou camp the table below shows how the attacking trios of barcelona ( messi , neymar and suarez ) and real madrid ( ronaldo , benzema and bale ) compare in all competitions . green indicates the player that comes out on top in that category , such as messi for goals , while those in red shows them as the worst of the six , such as neymar for assists .
( cnn ) when jeb bush spoke last week at the conservative political action conference in national harbor , maryland , the likely gop presidential hopeful did better than expected . of course , that could have been because expectations were so low . you remember " bush derangement syndrome . " when george w. bush was president , it afflicted liberals who thought the chief executive could n't do anything right . now that jeb might run for president in 2016 , the condition vexes conservatives who believe that when it comes to choosing the gop nominee , the former florida governor is all wrong . during bush 's speech , a few dozen supporters of sen. rand paul of kentucky -- wearing red t-shirts with the words " stand with rand " -- walked out and later blasted bush as insufficiently conservative . but what should really count for a lot is that bush is sufficiently competent . he 's the grownup in a roomful of extremists who -- as they compare union members to isis ( scott walker ) or vow to abolish the irs ( ted cruz ) or bash the media ( chris christie ) -- seem most interested in applause lines . bush is a serious person with a serious shot at the presidency , something that you just ca n't say about all republicans who appear to be running . as someone who is bilingual and whose wife hails from mexico , bush can hit hillary clinton , the likely democratic nominee , where it hurts by carving into her latino support . in his 1998 gubernatorial election , and 2002 re-election , bush received over 60 percent of the latino vote . and it 's no secret that , for many latinos who might vote for bush , the make-or-break issue is immigration . that 's because many latinos see immigration as a way of determining a candidate 's character . latinos will be watching to see if bush stands up to the pressure from extremists to join the gop 's closed border chorus . they 're used to being thrown under the bus by politicians who sacrifice latinos to gin up support from non-latinos . and they wo n't put up with it . so which way is bush going to go on immigration ? for many years , he extolled the contributions of immigrants and expressed dismay that elements of his party are closed-minded and mean-spirited on the issue . he even acknowledged that , to many , the party is seen as " anti-immigrant . " lately , though , bush has injected more nuance into his views -- and turned them mushy in the process . on the question of whether undocumented youth should have a path to citizenship , for example , bush at first supported the idea , then he opposed it . and most recently , he has said that he could support such a path if congress mandates it . on the arizona immigration law , bush apparently likes the concept of enlisting local police to be " the eyes and ears " of the border patrol . but he has also been sympathetic to critics who worry that this will lead to ethnic profiling of latinos . too often , bush leaves the impression that he 'll say whatever he needs to say to avoid conflict . so it was actually refreshing to see bush use his appearance at cpac -- which took the form of an onstage interview by conservative talk show host sean hannity -- to once again speak plainly . in response to questions , bush emphasized the need to secure the u.s. border , insisted that immigration policy should be driven by economic concerns and the need for high-skilled immigrants , and reaffirmed support for giving undocumented immigrants driver 's licenses and in-state tuition at public colleges and universities . the crowd booed that last one . bush criticized president obama 's executive actions to prioritize deportations , but also bashed republicans in congress for protesting that policy by holding up funds for the department of homeland security . finally , in response to what is often the most contentious aspect of this debate , bush also stressed the need to create a path to citizenship for millions of illegal immigrants who are currently in the united states . " i know there 's disagreement here , " he said . " the simple fact is that there is no plan to deport 11 million people . we should give them a path to legal status where they work ... and contribute to our society . " the way bush sees it , the gop is good at being against things but " we have to start being for things again . " in response to a heckler , bush stared out into the crowd to address his critic . " i 'm marking you down as neutral , " he told the heckler . " i 'll look forward to being your second choice . " in the washington times/cpac presidential preference straw poll of 3,007 participants , bush came in fifth out of 17 candidates with just 8 percent of the vote . first place went to rand paul , who earned 25.7 percent . clearly , bush has a long way to go in convincing conservatives that he 's their best choice . but his appearance at cpac set exactly the right tone . voters in both parties have plenty of candidates telling them what they want to hear just to get their support . what they need are more candidates who tell them what they need to hear : the truth . that wo n't make the candidates popular . but it does make them credible .

' she is believed to have been helped by syrian mohammed al-rashed , who was arrested last week on suspicion of getting the three east london schoolgirls across the border . her passport details were found on his laptop -- showing she and her children have been with islamic state fanatics for five weeks . mrs islam 's devastated husband azizul has previously told reporters he has not stopped crying since police revealed she had travelled to gaziantep , a popular gateway to syria for foreign fighters and jihadi brides . intelligence revealed mrs islam 's documents were found on mohammed al-rashed 's laptop , who was arrested on suspicion of helping shamima begum , kadiza sultana and amira abase ( pictured ) become jihadi brides ` it 's really hard for me , ' said the 36-year-old minicab driver . ' i have n't seen my kids for more than one month . i ca n't even sleep without my kids . ` my question is why did she go there ? she has two kids , she has a family , and this house is in her name . why has she left everything ? ` when the police told me she travelled to gaziantep -- i 've seen it in the news , so many british people are trying to travel there -- it came into my mind that maybe she 's gone to syria but still i ca n't believe it . ' turkish intelligence sources revealed her id documents were found on the laptop of mohammed al-rashed . he was arrested on suspicion of helping shamima begum , 15 , kadiza sultana , 16 , and amira abase , 15 , become jihadi brides in syria . all three attended bethnal green academy in tower hamlets . al-rashed , 28 , is said to have told detectives he has mainly helped british fighters but also south africans and australians . the details of two other britons , aged 19 and 29 , were on his laptop . mr islam said : ` he must 've also helped her to get there . ` i 'm worried about my kids , i hope she comes back with my kids . she 's going to destroy my two kids ' lives . ` is is killing muslim people as well . my religion does n't say anything about killing people . ` if you 're muslim you should know that the koran does n't say this . these people are dangerous .

' turkish intelligence sources said british authorities did not inform them that mrs islam might be travelling to syria until february 23 -- nine days after she landed in the country . turkey has faced criticism for not controlling its border with syria , but has accused european states in turn of failing to prevent would-be jihadists from leaving in the first place . there are increasing concerns about the growing numbers of young people being lured to the war zone in syria and iraq . security services estimate that more than 600 britons have gone to join militant groups since the explosion of violence in the region began . they include 22 women and girls who have travelled in the past 12 months , many of whom wanted to become jihadi brides .

the last salmon fisherman on the river severn is embroiled in a legal battle with the environment agency - after catching just a single fish too many . nigel mott , 71 , has been catching salmon in traditional basket traps since the 1970s and once netted up to 600 fish a year worth # 100 each . but his livelihood was thrown into doubt in 2012 when the environment agency ruled that no individual fisherman could land more than 30 in a season . nigel mott is the last remaining commercial salmon fisherman on the river severn and claims it is impossible for him to make a living if he is restricted to catching just 30 fish in a season nigel 's home in stroat , gloucestershire , is around six miles from the town of lydney , off which he fishes . the 71-year-old used to catch up to 600 salmon a year worth # 100 each defiant nigel continued to use his putcher rank - an array of 650 basket-like traps - and hit the quota in just 26 days . as a protest he presented his 31st fish to the local environment agency office - and was duly prosecuted . he won his case but the agency has now announced plans to appeal the decision . nigel said : ` when i caught the 30th fish , i rang them up and told them i was going to fish in excess of the 30 - i even brought them my 31st fish . ` they seized my fish and warned me of a prosecution - which is exactly what i wanted because i was very anxious to get my evidence before a court . ' the environment agency introduced the new quotas amid fears that the salmon population in the severn was dangerously low . nigel , of stroat , gloucestershire , has won his case , but must face another hearing in the court of appeal after catching his 31st fish nigel was prosecuted for breaching his licence and the case was heard at the high court in london in february . nigel , of stroat , gloucestershire , argued that the unreasonably low quota threatened his livelihood and would put him out of business . he claims his form of fishing has minimal impact on salmon in the severn , as his putchers stretch out just a couple of hundred metres from the riverbank . that leaves a mile of open water for the fish to swim past his cages , he argued , allowing plenty of space . despite winning the case his legal battle still shows no signs of ending as the environment agency has vowed to take it to the court of appeal . a spokesman said : ` although the judge has at this stage ruled in mr mott 's favour , we will be seeking leave to appeal to the court of appeal . ` all of these sites are designated to protect salmon , and these populations are currently under threat . ` we impose restrictions on salmon fishing for all fisheries in these areas because of the need to protect the designated habitats and fisheries .

coroner mary hassell , who claims she has been left in fear of violence after being falsely accused of anti-semitism a senior coroner has accused orthodox jews of bullying and intimidating her in an extraordinary row over the handling of dead bodies . mary hassell claims she and her staff have been left in fear of violence after being bombarded by hundreds of complaints about how they deal with deaths in devoutly religious communities . in a letter seen by the mail on sunday , she says she has been falsely accused of anti-semitism and warns the situation risks becoming ` volatile ' . she says that on one occasion the police had to be called when 60 orthodox jews refused to let undertakers take the body of a man whose body they wanted to pray over . mrs hassell believes other families in the north london area she covers are ` suffering ' because she has to spend so much of her time dealing with the large number of orthodox jews , whose faith requires them to bury their dead quickly and prevents them undergoing autopsies . but the orthodox jews say they are being ` traumatised ' by the coroner 's disregard for their beliefs , forcing them to take unprecedented legal action against her . both sides will soon face each other in the high court in a case that could lead to all families being given the right to demand a high-tech scan to determine cause of death rather than the traditional surgical post - mortem examination . in a letter to her bosses at camden council , mrs hassell writes : ` i look forward to hearing how you intend to support those who work within the service for which you have statutory responsibility , and protect them from bullying , intimidation and the threat of violence . ' but rabbi asher gratt told this newspaper : ` the jewish community is increasingly traumatised by mrs hassell 's conduct . it 's getting to the point where elderly people are scared to die in england -- literally . a pair of orthodox jews wait for a bus in london . in their faith , they believe they need to bury their loved ones within a day of their death so the period of mourning can begin ` i 'm actually aware of at least one elderly couple who have happily lived in the uk since the second world war but who have now emigrated permanently due to their fear of being subjected to unnecessary delays of their funerals when they pass away -- or , worse still , a post-mortem autopsy . ' the row has arisen because jews believe they need to bury their loved ones within a day of their death so the period of mourning can begin . they also believe that traditional post-mortem examinations amount to desecration of the body . but when a doctor is unable to state a cause of death and sign the medical certificate needed before a body can be released for burial , a coroner must decide if a post-mortem examination is required . this process can take several days . following years of campaigning by muslims and jews -- who share many beliefs on burial customs -- the ministry of justice has agreed that all coroners in london will operate an out-of-hours service from next month . others in england and wales already do so .
the appliance of science behind ronny deila 's celtic reign was there for all to see on sunday afternoon . any lingering scepticism about his methods surely went the same way as aberdeen 's resistance . despite playing with 10 men for much of a demanding , frustrating 90 minutes against inter milan three days previously -- and the associated , sleep-disturbing travelling -- deila 's team simply ran all over their perceived title rivals in the second half of a 4-0 victory . it was an impressive display of physical power and mental focus . the norwegian 's insistence that celtic could be fitter caused a fair degree of controversy early in his tenure . it was interpreted -- or perhaps misinterpreted -- as a slight on predecessor neil lennon . ronny deila 's celtic side are starting to become formidable under the norwegian 's reign at parkhead but this much is clear . deila has unquestionably made the parkhead side more formidable in that regard . and he has all the stats to back it up . including one which earned recent arrival gary mackay-steven a rapid ( in more ways than one ) gold star . crunching the numbers after matches is an important aspect of deila 's work when it comes to assessing various aspects of his players ' performances . to the 39-year-old , these reams of figures produced by the technology at celtic 's disposal provide an objective view to place alongside his managerial opinion . the hope is that it leads to better decisions . again , there would have been a few from the football old-school previously willing to raise an eyebrow at such talk . but what happened at the weekend provided a riposte to any sneers . deila ( centre ) is keen on his players being the fittest and results have shown impressive statistics ` i think the most important thing is that the players see and also the people around them - you and everybody - see that what we are doing is effective , ' said deila . ` there are always things that we can do better and we have had some bad results , but i think we have had six victories after coming home from european games . you do n't see that around the other european leagues . inter milan lost at the weekend and they are struggling a lot when they come back -- so we did well to win in that way . ` the amount of metres and sprints on sunday was unbelievable when you consider we played three days before . we have increased the high-intensity running by 30-40 percent since the summer . gary mackay-steven ( right ) ran an impressive 1300 metres against aberdeen on sunday ` we want to be direct , we want to create things , we want to have penetration , we want to be a high-pressing team , so you have to run quick and you see that in the stats and in how we perform . ' asked if he knew which of his players topped the various statistic tables , deila broke into a grin . ` i know everything about the players , ' he laughed . ` when we played inter at home , their striker , rodrigo palacio , ran 1250 metres at high intensity against us , sprinting . that is an incredible number . but at the weekend gary mackay-steven ran 1300m ! ` you have to know the references of what it means to be fit . it 's easy to say that to the other players , if i tell them how far gary mackay-steven ran in a game and compare it to them . deila highlighted how impressive palacio 's running was against his side in the europa league clash ` if a player asks me why he is sitting on the bench and not playing , i can show him the numbers . if he is running 600m and the guy in the team is running 1200m , what does he think of that ? ` why ca n't gary run as far every game ? stuart armstrong ran 900m on sunday and he did n't play the whole game . ' it was pointed out that armstrong actually lasted only 62 minutes after replacing kris commons against aberdeen , before being hurt and making way for anthony stokes . was that not evidence of the midfielder being overworked ? the winger also scored a terrific solo goal against their title rivals to send the bhoys six points clear ` it was cramp , he 'll be okay for ( tonight 's game ) against st johnstone , ' said the celtic manager . ` it was a sign that he is not strong enough yet . you have to think of the mental and physical loading on a player . ` just coming to celtic - dealing with the contract , the media and so on - used a lot of mental energy in gary and stuart . ` then the training is at a much higher tempo then they have been used to before . the total loading gets too much . that 's why stuart started on the bench . ` but then scott brown is doing it every day . he is so strong , unbelievably strong . because he has done this for many years , he works really hard every single day and he looks after himself . stefan johansen is also starting to get that into his body . ' so is it a case of simply saying the best teams are the fittest teams ? scott brown has been praised by his manager for his unbelievable strength and work ethic ` no , that 's not true , ' countered deila . ` but that 's the easiest thing to do something with . i do n't think the best teams are the fittest -- they could be -- but there are so many parameters , so many boxes you have to fill in football . ` we do n't train more than they did before but hopefully we train better and we give more in that hour-and-a-half every day . ` as for the stats , we use them in different situations . it is not only stats about running but who has been involved in goal chances offensively and defensively . instead of saying something subjectively , you can see it as a fact . stuart armstrong is also a willing runner for celtic and his stats are impressive since he joined the club ` but everything has to be related to football . we are not marathon runners . it is about what we do on the pitch . ' what celtic have done on scottish pitches is win their last 10 domestic matches . making it 11 against st johnstone at parkhead will push them nine points clear of aberdeen . complacency might be the creeping danger , but deila does n't detect any traces of that corrosive commodity . ` there is still so much to fight for , ' he insisted . ` we are working here on the culture , every day , to be 100 per cent every day . ` i have no reason to be worried because i have n't once seen the players have a bad attitude or a lack of concentration . i am really looking forward to the game and i expect a good performance and hopefully a good result .

australian rugby league referees are to ditch their pink jerseys , because they believe it jeopardises their authority . with the nrl season due to begin again this week , the sydney morning herald is reporting that officials have been switched out of pink for the coming campaign . instead , the referees will wear blue or red , depending on the kits of the two teams involved in any game . nrl referees have ditched the idea of pink jerseys after claims they undermined official 's authority the new colours have been chosen as they apparently encourage discipline but the move has come in for criticism . performance psychologist chris pomfret said it was purely a symbolic gesture which would n't change how the game was refereed . ` the colour of a uniform is irrelevant to the skill execution of referees , just the same as the colour of a jersey worn by players is irrelevant to their skill execution , ' he said . ` in short , the colour of a uniform should n't matter as it does n't directly impact on the performance of a referee , which ultimately has the most influence on their perceived credibility . ' officials will wear red or blue for the new season , which starts this , in a move that has been criticised there was also a suggestion that the nrl risked alienating the gay community and breast cancer awareness campaigners . dr tom heenean , from the natonal centre for australian studies , told the bbc it was a move away from ` social inclusion . ' ` if you are wanting a more inclusive football community you have to be more aware of the symbolisms of marginal groups within that community , ' he said .
a dramatic surge by the snp looks set to claim gordon brown 's scottish seat and rob ed miliband of a commons majority , according to a new poll last night . the study of marginal constituencies suggests labour and the conservatives are heading for electoral deadlock in may , with neither party able to govern alone . the poll , commissioned by former tory treasurer lord ashcroft , suggests the snp is on course for a landslide at the general election , winning as many as 56 of scotland 's 59 seats - up from just six at present . the poll , commissioned by former tory treasurer lord ashcroft , suggests the snp is on course for a landslide at the general election , winning as many as 56 of scotland 's 59 seats - up from just six at present . the snp surge would claim seats held by a string of household names , including those of departing gordon brown and alistair darling , and former lib dem leader charles kennedy . the tories are also in danger of losing their one scottish seat , held by david mundell . at westminster the poll suggests labour and the conservatives will be tied on 272 seats each - well short of the 326 needed to command a commons majority . lord ashcroft said the astonishing surge by the snp in the wake of last year 's independence referendum had thrown a ` giant spanner in labour 's works ' , although the party is forecast to win tory seats south of the border . of the eight scottish seats polled , the snp would gain six - including four from labour - and tie with mr mundell , in dumfriesshire , clydesdale and tweeddale . ` it is hard to see things getting any worse for labour in scotland , while things are on a knife-edge elsewhere , ' lord ashcroft said . ` but as things stand , labour losses in scotland could offset their gains from the tories , leading to something close to a dead heat . ` this , then , is the battle : can the conservatives fight back against labour faster than labour can fight back against the snp ? ' labour 's leader in scotland jim murphy ( right ) is facing an uphill battle to hang on to labour 's 40 seats north of the border the snp surge is on course to claim seats held by a string of household names , including those of departing gordon brown and alistair darling the poll throws up the prospect of a weak ed miliband government propped up by nicola sturgeon 's snp - she has ruled out supporting a tory government . the two pardicts ties would have a combined total of 328 seats - producing a commons majority of just three . former first minister alex salmond , who is planning a return to westminster , has refused to rule out becoming a government minister in the country he tried to break up as part of any deal . and the snp has warned that it will demand a ruinously high price from labour , including billions more in spending and borrowing , home rule for scotland and the scrapping of britain 's trident nuclear deterrent . tory peer lord ashcroft has carried out a series of polls in marginal scottish constituencies the new polling suggests that the snp will make deep inroads into labour 's scottish heartlands , and all but eradicate the lib dems north of the border . gordon brown 's kirkcaldy and cowdenbeath seat , where the former prime minister is stepping down , currently has one of the biggest labour majorities in the country . but the new poll forecasts an incredible 28.5 per cent swing to the snp , giving the nationalists a comfortable six-point lead . in edinburgh south west , where former chancellor alistair darling is also stepping down , the poll pre-another snp win , on the back of a 22 per cent swing . in ross , skye and lochaber , which mr kennedy has held since 1983 , a 21.5 per cent swing to the nationalists looks set to hand the seat to former snp treasurer ian blackford . scottish secretary alistair carmichael , in orkney and shetland , could be left as the only lib dem mp in scotland . new scottish labour leader jim murphy is forecast to cling on in east renfrewshire , despite a 20.5 per cent swing to the snp . but , in this scenario , he could be one of only two labour mps remaining . mr murphy last night said david cameron would be ` rubbing his hands with glee ' at the findings as they suggested the nationalist surge could prevent a labour victory . he added : ` we ca n't let david cameron back into downing street by the back door . that would be a disaster for scotland , but it looks like that is what might happen if these polls in scotland are repeated on election day . ' snp election chief angus robertson described the findings as ` very encouraging ' and showed the party was picking up seats across scotland , including in areas that rejected independence , such as the borders , where mr mundell is facing a knife-edge battle to cling on . a scottish tory spokesman said : ` this poll shows that the scottish conservatives are now in a real fight across scotland . ` with the liberal democrat vote having collapsed completely , we offer scots the opportunity to unite around a plan to finish the job of economic recovery and to secure scotland 's place in the uk - any other vote will let ed miliband into downing street , with alex salmond calling the shots . ' a scottish lib dem spokesman added : ` these polls show that lib dems are best placed to stop the snp in the highlands and the north east . the snp have centralised services away from the highlands and the north-east to the central belt .
